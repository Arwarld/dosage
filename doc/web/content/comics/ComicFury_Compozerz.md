-----------------------------------------

<tr>
<th>Description</th><td>The Compozerz is the story of five classical composers from the 17-1800s, who find themselves whisked suddenly into the 21st century. The Guys have no idea why or how this happened, and to top things off, they find themselves stranded in the middle of the North American Desert. Frightened and confused, The Boys must figure out where they are and find out some answers. They end up stumbling upon a truck stop/diner and meet the free-spirited &quot;hippie&quot; chick, Connie Sanderson, who ends up 'adopting' the Guys. So here unfolds the tale of Time Traveling Musicians Johannes &quot;Joe&quot; Brahms, Felix Mendelssohn, Frederic &quot;Freddie&quot; Chopin, Wolfgang &quot;Wolfie&quot; Mozart, Ludwig Van Beethoven and of course, Miss Sanderson (who must have some pretty incredible patience). Connie is not-so-loosely based on the author of the comic, by the way.</td>
