<th>Description</th><td>Jeremy Locke is just a normal high school student, but his best friend Erik has a secret. He's a vampire and not just any vampire, a prince! Alexei Drako is Erik's ex-fiance and he's the prince of Neutrals, a race mostly like the humans but with the power to use magic and known to live longer than five centuries. Two years after his painful break up with Erik, he's back to look for a new &quot;wife&quot; and has set his eyes on Jeremy! Will Erik let this happen and will Cleo Saint, Jeremy's stalker friend, allow it as well? *Not really planning to put mature things in it yet but it does contain strong language and sometime in the future partial nudity. It's not just Shounen Ai, there's hetero love too *UPDATES ON FRIDAY AND/OR SATURDAY*</td>
