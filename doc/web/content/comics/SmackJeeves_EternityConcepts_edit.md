<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">WARNING: This is a yaoi manga. There is no sex--but there is some suggestion, and a large amount of adult humor. Julian--err, Father Julian--Father Skyy? Just call him Julian--is a priest at Sacred Heart Cathedral. . .and deeply depressed. After a long struggle with his depression, he concludes a deadly solution, convinced it's the only one he has; En route to take his own life, Julian discovers the body of another man who's beaten him to the same punch--and in the snap moment of a life or death situation, Julian forgoes his plans to save a life. Thus he meets Hollow, a depressed Atheist whom Julian now accredits his illumination to happiness to; Having now come to close to experiencing the damage he himself was about to cause, Julian feels transformed--and wants to return the favor to Hollow and do the same for him. If he can't--surely God can! While they agree to disagree, Hollow and Julian form an odd, close friendship--and soon, Julian forgets about converting Hollow and begins to realize his feelings. . .may mean something else. All the while, they're never aware of the danger lurking in the shadows. . .</textarea></td>
