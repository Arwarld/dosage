<th>Description</th><td>&quot;Looks like the kids of Sludge-High really should have skipped school today.&quot; Rated bizarre for: monsters, zombies, cannibalism, school girls, unrequited love (with a vengeance), government conspiracy, chocolate bunnies, angels vs. demons, all that with a limb or two to spare. Not making any sense? Its not supposed to! So grab a shovel and kick back for one hell of a nightmare.</td>
