<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Fifteen years ago, mankind faced a terrible disaster. In order to protect his daughter, Hinata, from danger, Shinsuke Akao retreated deep into the forest. He secluded himself, never leaving the forest while he reared and educated Hinata, never allowing her to leave either. On the morning after her sixteenth birthday, Hinata wakes up to find her father missing. With no clues as to where he went, Hinata casts aside the safety of the forest and forges out for the first time into the post-apocalyptic cityscape on a quest to find her father and discover what exactly happened to the world fifteen years ago.</textarea></td>
