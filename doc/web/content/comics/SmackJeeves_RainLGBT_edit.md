<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">Written by Jocelyn C.D. (aka LittleLynn84) &quot;Rain&quot; is a comedy/drama that follows the daily life of teenage transsexual (who is coincidentally named Rain) attempting to go through her senior year being only identified as a woman. Iâ€™d like for it to be very funny and entertaining, but the story will also touch on many rather heavy subjects including acceptance from family and piers, blind hatred and many of the other difficulties faced by members of the LGBT community. This comic contains: - Occasionally strong language - Sexual themes and situations (but no nudity) - Gay, lesbian, bi and transgendered (and straight) characters - Lousy or non-existent backgrounds</textarea></td>
