<th>Description</th><td>Internet Superbuddies is an experiment in chaos theory, pixels, and utter fucking boredom. It features five protagonists who basically swear and hate each other and are in some kind of bizarre and unclear living situation, to where they also break the fourth wall and realize they're part of a grander machination of being in an experiment in chaos theory, pixels, and utter fucking boredom. It used to be based on real life. Then people started getting killed and orcs with intent to rape started showing up. Then things got wacky.</td>
