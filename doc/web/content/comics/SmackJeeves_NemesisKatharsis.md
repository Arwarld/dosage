<th>Description</th><td>Jove is the descendant of the most powerful magical clan in Nokt'ader - the Aerin. She is expected to be a magic user of legend by her parents and clan. Unfortunately, she cannot even learn how to... levitate. With almost no affinity for magic, and considered the black sheep of her family, Jove harbors the ridiculous notion of one day becoming the land's... Arch Mistress of Magic! Updating schedule: heavily variable! :s I'm also working on Sailor Moon: The Enemy Next Door, and that's my priority :) but as this here is MY baby, I'll do my best to post often Genre: fantasy/adventure/romance Edit 10.12.2012: Regarding updating, I've decided to get more regular and update at least ONCE per week. What day of the week that will be is literally dependent on the position of the stars. But at least I'm introducing some structure. Yay!</td>
