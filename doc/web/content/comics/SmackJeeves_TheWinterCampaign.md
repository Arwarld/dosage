<th>Description</th><td>Japan, 1919. 16-year-old Akio and his mother move into a new home with the mysterious Kikugawa family: A secretive father, a fragile and reclusive son, and the shadow of a mother whose death years ago may be more than it appears. The lines between truth and fantasy, and friend and enemy begin to blur as winter sets in... Drama/Historical/Coming-Of-Age/Romance? Contains angsty teenagers, Taishou-era geekery on the part of the author, and some BL. Updates once or twice a week.</td>
