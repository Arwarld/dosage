Dosage comic SmackJeeves/FruitloopAndMrDownbeat
-----------------------------------------

<table class="comicinfo">
<tr>
<th>Description</th><td>After hitting a bump in the road of life, Danny Lawson ended up moving back to the city where he attended college. His next door neighbor, Alan Taylor, is a senior in high school who falls in love with Danny almost immediately. AND THUS THEY BECAME FRUITLOOP &amp; MR. DOWNBEAT. (bad intro, yes.) (contains boy/boy, girl/girl, foul language, cartoon violence, some sexual themes) Schedule is being removed for the time being. Updates whenever the author can get her crap together &lt;xD'. (gonna aim for once a week?) (Note: A friend recently brought it up to me that she saw something on tv from the south where 'Fruitloop' was actually being actively used as a derogatory word. This comic means no offense, and the author wasn't aware that it was being used that way.)</td>
