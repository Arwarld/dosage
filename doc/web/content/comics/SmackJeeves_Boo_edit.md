<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">* Updates on Fridays * On a Halloween night a little girl named Kat opens a strange box, releasing hundreds of monsters as well as the Boogeyman (AKA Boo) onto her town. Boo and Kat must work together to protect themselves from these monsters that now lurk in the shadows, but is that what they really should be afraid of? Because little do they know a retired hit-man from Boo's past named Cain is coming to Kat's town to make sure the Boogeyman he locked away years ago is still dormant. As the story unfolds we peek into Boo's past, when he was a child. We follow him on his tragic/strange journey to becoming the Boogeyman and ultimately his imprisonment in a box that Kat eventually opens over 100 years later. Cain is on his way for a head-on confrontation with Boo and poor Kat is stuck in the middle of it all. Are there answers in the past that can save their futures? Or are they all doomed to be eaten by the monsters that continue to be constant threat to everyone? Can now be bought on Lulu.com (hint-hint, nudge-nudge)</textarea></td>
