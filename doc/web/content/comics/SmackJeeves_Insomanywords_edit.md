<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Sam Moore's 20 year old world is shifting on its axis, whether he's ready for it or not, and his relationship to his best friend Charlie is at the center of it all. But no friendly warnings, social boundaries, disabilities, self denial, Charlie's pretty girlfriend, nor the mayor of town can stop Sam's growing curiosity towards the quirky, blonde boy he's never had to live without. (art improves as you go on) Warnings: Adult content, Nudity, Profanity, Child Abuse/Neglect, and Alcoholism are all topics expected to be present in this comic. Slice of Life/Romance/&quot;Dramedy&quot; Uploads: Random days but frequently, 2 pages at a time</textarea></td>
