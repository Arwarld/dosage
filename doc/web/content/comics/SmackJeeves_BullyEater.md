<th>Description</th><td>Bullying is a very serious issue, especially if the bullies are superhuman martial artists! Isao Akia, A high school student, figured that after training in the martial arts his days of being bullied would be over. And they were until he was transferred to &quot;Long Wei High&quot; a school owned by a deadly Chinese syndicate called the &quot;Nine Dragons&quot;. At this school a school yard brawl could level an entire city!</td>
