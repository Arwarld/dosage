<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">Elizabeth Rodenberg is an eighteen-year-old first-year college student on her way to her apartment with groceries when she hears a voice in an unknown language out of nowhere. She's always known she was a little crazy. But before she can even dismiss it as a hallucination, Liz is suddenly very far away from home - and laying before the soon-to-be Hero of Twilight. There she meets a short Californian girl named Lita, who is equally confused and out-of place. Brought to Hyrule by an unknown person, for an unknown mission, Liz and Lita struggle to understand their situation. They find that Link is more cold and unwilling than they remember, that Midna is more paranoid and irritable, Zelda, more cryptic and distant; and the true reality of what the two girls think they know has yet to fall upon them. Their reckless actions have consequences. Their newly forged friendship will be tested. All for Link. Maybe in the end everything will be worth the struggle. Contains: Corniness, awkwardness, sexual frustration, nerdy references, one-liners, somewhat coarse language, violence, blood. Processed in a plant that handles nuts. Updates weekly. Sometimes more than once.</textarea></td>
