<th>Description</th><td>loosely translated: &quot; inner feelings /what is deep in one's heart&quot; The one that devoured the Eceshion bible holds the source to the worlds survival; Those who are being destroyed and those who are now conquering. Take heed that the one who devoured such a powerful book needs to know how to control it or it will cause destruction to all living beings. Claim it as your own, but don't let it sit forever unclaimed, for in the end one must decide what is more important, the ones close to you, our survival or the one we are omitted to care for. contains: boys love, cross dressing, monsters,vampires, animal people all around dementedness. NOTES: (Posting because it is a collaborative comic with Dani) 1. the comic was drawn back in 2009, so the art is a bit wonky till it catches up 2. The comic content does contain yaoi, However, due to smack jeeves rules and regulations: that content WILL NOT be seen on this site. The yaoi version of the comic in full will be seen on a Tumblr. this version is the version that contains black out pages and currently redrawn to contain version without Yaoi. 3. posting will be daily till it's caught up to the latest page: 1 page a day.</td>
