<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">Four years ago, Robbie Finch met his best friend on the Internet. Now he's off to college in that very friend's home town--well, city. Big city. Orson and his friends are exactly the kind of people Robbie wants to meet: punks, hipsters, queers, and artists like himself. It's their exploits that push him headfirst into a new kind of reality, one where the Fair Folk and humanity meet. The city of Glory is full of well-kept secrets, but they might just unravel them all.</textarea></td>
