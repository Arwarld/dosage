<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Jacob comes home from school one day and finds out a family is moving in next door to him. The oldest daughter, Kaylee, is a very kind and optimistic girl who is the same age as him. And to his surprise, she was his best childhood friend! It’s been eight years since they have last seen eachother, but after Kaylee’s return his life isn’t the same. *Updates: Random for now This is my first comic and I'm always experimenting with new techniques and keep trying to improve, so constructive criticism is always welcome. I'm also in the process of redoing the comic and replacing the old pages. So if you're wondering why my style has changed after a few pages, that's why! Other than that, I hope you enjoy the story!</textarea></td>
