It's a story about a group of adolescents living dull or miserable lives who seek comfort in their own fantasy world. They all encounter a similar situation which transports them to a lawless, fantasy world that shapes itself to their inner desires. There is no time to age them, no rules to control them, no authority to subdue them. As they search for a way to return to the real world, they begin to question if they want to leave at all.</textarea></td>
