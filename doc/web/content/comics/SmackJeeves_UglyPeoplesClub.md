<th>Description</th><td>Lesley, finally a high school freshman, is a pretty girl with an ugly temper. One day, while skipping class with her only friend, she's caught and given detention. But instead of an after-school punishment, she finds a small group of really ugly students, known as the Ugly People's Club. And they want her to be their leader. **This is an American comic; please read left to right!** UPDATES: This comic updates EVERY Friday, with occasional Monday/Wednesday updates. ;)</td>
