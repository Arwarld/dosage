<th>Description</th><td>The universe has always been an enigmatic place to human kind. It is said that eons ago, the only thing that existed was a dark, foreboding void. In time, however the Gods created the stars, the planets, and above all, life. This was their masterpiece work. Each God contributed a portion of their power to the creation of human kind....but....the Gods were betrayed by one of their own; The God of Time. After cursing humanity, and nearly driving the rest of the Gods to extinction, he was eventually sealed, and his powerful weapon was banished to the furthest reaches of the universe. But...there are other fearsome creatures that reside in the darkness. Evil things. Living nightmares that seep into this world from where our dimension meets another...</td>
