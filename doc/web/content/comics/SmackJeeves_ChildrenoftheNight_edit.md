<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Vampires are at the brink of extinction ruled with a heavy hand by the Hunters, an order of vampire slayers that has existed since the beginning of mankind. The centuries-old law is very clear; a vampire can only feed off criminals whose names are on the lists provided by the Hunters. Any other interaction with humans means punishment and even execution if they are harmed. But when an unlikely friendship between a human girl and a vampire starts to grow into something much deeper, can these laws be obeyed? CotN is a romance webcomic set in the Victorian Era, depicting forbidden love amidst a clash between vampires and the Hunters, an order of vampire slayers. :It updates every Monday:</textarea></td>
