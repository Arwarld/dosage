<th>Description</th><td>this comic is just my idea of what a creepypasta world would be like. no its not meant to be taken too seriously, its mostly a way for people who are severally disturbed by creepypasta to have something to help them gget over their fears. so here is a comic that will make you laugh, giggle, and smile. i know it's hard to be scared guys, this comic is here for you. I hope you enjoy Pastamonsters i know i love making it! i have to put this up here for a slight confusion a few people had. i do not own any of these characters, they belong to whoever made the creepypastas respectively.</td>
