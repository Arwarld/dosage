<th>Description</th><td>These are all of the old Elastikid comics from prior to February, 2011. This was before Joe decided to become a superhero, and consists mostly of gag-a-day jokes with no real overall storyline. The tone of the series was rather different, so rather than continue on this comic, I decided to release all of the new strips as a &quot;sequel&quot; comic continuing in the same continuity. You can read the current Elastikid strips at http://elastikid.smackjeeves.com/ which is still being updated.</td>
