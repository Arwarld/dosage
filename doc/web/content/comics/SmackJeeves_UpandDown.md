<th>Description</th><td>This story takes place in a pretty rotten city. Pollution is everywhere. Shooting and murder are the daily deal. Illegal services, experiments, weapons, drugs, etc are everywhere. This story will be told in different perspectives. One perspective is told from our main characters, 2 cops. Another perspective is told from XXX and XXX (don't wanna spoil xD) So basicly, there's 3 perspectives in which this story will be told. It is going to be a long one... and I really hope I'll be able to complete it one day... be that be in a year or 3 years. I'm going to take my darned sweet time. xD Updates when I have time and/or when I'm in the mood. Normally, when I update, I try to update multiple pages at once. (as in draw one, update, draw another, update) I can't promise the completion, but I will try my best to finish it. Contains BL, it's a heads up for those who dislike it or feels offended by it. There might be inappropriate jokes, etc, and profanity and violence. This is just a comic so please don't use it as a role model..... READ LEFT TO RIGHT</td>
