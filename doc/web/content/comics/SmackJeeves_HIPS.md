<th>Description</th><td>An admittedly done before bl romance. Here is my attempt at a gripping back cover summary: In an effort to get away from his criminal family, Julius Green has turned witness for the city. He is secreted away and hidden in a posh private academy as...a girl?! Suffocated by the charade, will Julius be able to pull off school life as Penny Adams? And will he be able to save himself when the two rulers of the school, Max Lawson and Alex Watch, take particular interest in him?</td>
