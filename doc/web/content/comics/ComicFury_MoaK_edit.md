<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Morgan was not having a good day. Her singer flounced; her basist, and brother, got a better offer; her drummer was blown up by a dragon-- Wait, what's a dragon doing in Chicago? And what's with the orcs with guns? Updates Tuesdays and Fridays, 3pm Chicago time (Currently a mirror from Drunk Duck. You can read it here, about a chapter behind, but with no delays for Writer's block and computer issues, or there for the current story, but with the occasional filler page/missed updates.)</textarea></td>
