<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Eliza Jones always had a dream of opening a cafe, but met a tragic fate before she ever could. Thus, the Caf√© d'Alizee was opened in her honor. This story really isn't about her, though. Instead, this story follows the interesting, strange, and in some cases eccentric staff of the Cafe d'Alizee as they wander through the trials and tribulations of life. They may not know where they are going, but they have the four most important things in the world: love, life, coffee, and cake. *Updates every Monday and Thursday.* P.S. I should also mention that because this comic deals with the lives of various people, there may be situations that include relationships of any gender combination as well as violence or sexual situations, but there will be nothing graphic. So because they are (mostly) all adults, expect adult situations to occur. :)</textarea></td>
