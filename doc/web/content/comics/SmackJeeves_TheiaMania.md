<th>Description</th><td>My own take on Greek mythology. It's like the gods would have been ordinary people, i.e. no superheroes, no big action. Rather, it's everyday relation life and philosophical, although sometimes emotionally charged (like real life). Occasionally though, the gods have a magical trick or two up their sleeve. :) Join Hermes, Hades, Persephone, Athena and the others as they try to deal with themselves, their complicated family and those strange humans. NEKYIA: A journey down to the Underworld. A philosopher and a necromantic priestess enter Hades' realm to find the answer to the question what a good life really is. At the same time, the messenger god Hermes arrives with a message to Hades... DADDY'S GIRL: Athena is miraculously born from her father's head. She's stronger and more intelligent than most people, but deep down she is just a confused child who tries to understand herself, her family and the world around her. This story takes place long before the events in NEKYIA. Updates usually once a week.</td>
