<th>Description</th><td>My own take on Greek mythology. Join Hermes, Hades, Persephone, Athena and the others as they try to deal with themselves, their complicated family and those strange humans. NEKYIA: A journey down to the Underworld. A philosopher and a necromantic priestess enter Hades' realm to find the answer to the question what a good life really is. At the same time, the messenger god Hermes arrives with a message to Hades... DADDY'S GIRL: Athena is miraculously born from her father's head. She's stronger and more intelligent than most people, but deep down she is just a confused child who tries to understand herself, her family and the world around her. This story takes place long before the events in NEKYIA. HERO BONES: A short story about Hermes, love and fossils. Has some mature content, but nothing too explicit. Takes place after NEKYIA DESTROYER OF LIGHT: Tells the story of Persephone and her life with her mother, the harvest goddess Demeter, before she became the queen of the Underworld. Snakes, flowers and dark secrets. Has some mature content. Updates usually once a week.</td>
