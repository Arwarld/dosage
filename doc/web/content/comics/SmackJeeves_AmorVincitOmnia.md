<th>Description</th><td>It is said, that on the day I was born an angel descended from the heavens. He delivered unto me a blessing... and a curse. Updates once weekly (Unless I say otherwise) (Oh, and most likely on weekends) Warnings: -This is a Bl comic. That means man on man action. So don't be suprised, 'kay? I may also do het and gl pairings later if I feel like it. -Rating WILL be boosted to mature later on. Also, it can be rated mature for anything. I like to keep my options open.</td>
