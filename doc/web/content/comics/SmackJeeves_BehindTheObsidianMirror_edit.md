<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">If you were to awake in a place unknown to you, without remembering anything... you would be happy to be taken in by someone, right? But what if this someone was a god? Aztec gods and BL. What more could you want? x3x Warnings for homosexual content, blood, violence, and possibly gore and sex in the future. Don't like, don't read. UPDATES EVERY TUESDAY!! Although I have read a lot about Aztecs and their culture and mythology, I am hardly an expert on that subject. So forgive everything that might be off, or wrong, since I actually don't bother to get everything right or just change things to my liking. The Aztecs and their religion etc. depicted in this comic are far from realistic, and don't aim to be, although I'm trying to make it all seem plausible. Just so you know. Enjoy. ;) Remember to read from right to left, Japanese reading order. ;) Sketch/WIP tumblr: http://teejaystumbles.tumblr.com/</textarea></td>
