<th>Description</th><td>Here are some game consoles. They are old. They don't work very well. They are slightly discolored. Did I mention that they don't work well? This comic used to be called &quot;Mommy, my NES crapped out on me AGAIN!!!&quot; but then I started showing some other console glitches.</td>
