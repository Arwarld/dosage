<th>Description</th><td>Shot out of Canon is the new direction for the former Fallout Shelter Comics. Like the Fallout Shelter Comics, it'll be about the forums (and sometimes comics) I go to. Unlike the former Fallout Shelter Comics, this will deal with things besides there. And unlike that, it won't be Canon with my Main Comics. Formerly: My Fallout Shelter Comics I do for the Fallout Shelter: http://z1.invisionfree.com/forums/The_Fallout_Shelter/index.php?act=idx</td>
