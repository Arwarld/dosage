<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">The Silver League is a comic based around the members of the site of the same name and placing them in our own interpretation of the Pokemon World. Silver August of Harvestone Town is a teen that never really knew life outside his hometown; however after rescuing his Sister from the hands of Team Reaction, Silver becomes motivated to explore the world as a PokÃ©mon Trainer! However on his journey, Silver discovers that behind the battles he'd watch on TV lies corruption because of devices known as &quot;Modifiers&quot; that allow a Trainer to alter a Pokemon's stats by force without having to earn them through training. This leads Silver and the friends he makes along the way to form &quot;The Silver League Movement&quot; which vows to travel the region, collecting badges but also recruiting Gym Leaders and convincing them to join their cause so that they can form a league of their own, take down the Team Reaction organization and bring honour, fun and hard work back to Pokemon Battles! http://www.thesilverleague.com/</textarea></td>
