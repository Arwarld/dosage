<th>Description</th><td>“The Snow just keeps falling, never melting away, never allowing spring to arrive.” Shirayama, a small mountain town, hasn’t seen spring in decades. Young man named Keiji suffers from fear of cold, and wants nothing more than get away from the town and its prevailing eternal winter. However, when he encounters a mysterious girl called Lumi and finds out the secret behind the mysterious hypothermia deaths, he has to confront his own fears, not only for his own, but also for the entire town’s future. ---------------------- Updates on Mondays</td>
