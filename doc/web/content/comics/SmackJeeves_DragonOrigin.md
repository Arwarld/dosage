<th>Description</th><td>On a island somewhere, hidden to the human eye, are shape shifting creatures called dragons. This island is the beginning of almost every dragon. This island is called 'Origin'. Dragons occasionally leave their nest at Origin and venture into the human domains. Some of them form relationships with humans as their guardians and the humans as their tamers. One particularly unlucky dragon decides to leave origin. He spends his life cautious of other living things and always alone. He vowed never to trust any one. That is, until a young girl comes along and earned his trust. Now he has a new vow. To protect this girl that has become his tamer, no matter what. Little does he know, there are more things in store for him then just protecting his new tamer. Contains: Romance, blood, violence.</td>
