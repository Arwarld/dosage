<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">Jumping on the bandwagon with my first nuzlocke and my first webcomic. For those who are unfamiliar with what a Nuzlocke is, here are the rules: 1.) Pokemon that are KO'd are considered dead and must be permanently placed in a box or released. If all your Pokemon in your party die (aka you whiteout) you lose. 2.) You are only allowed to catch the first Pokemon you find in each route. If you kill it or run away, you are not allowed to catch anymore Pokemon in that route. This includes fishing. (Shiny Pokemon are exempted from this rule because they're cool) 3.) You must nickname every Pokemon you catch. 4.) No legendaries. 5.)No Day Care Center</textarea></td>
