<th>Description</th><td>Comic updates Tuesday unless otherwise stated. The hostility between our two lead comic artists is slowly dissipating but lots of things are changing for our little group in general. Many are moving, some are having revaluations about their life, but nothing is going to stop them from enjoying the Halloween Party at the DVDungeon. Volume 2 of Frame by Frame has it all; ghosts, romance, and angry ex girlfriends to boot. +Alex is at his wits end with Tai, his ex-girlfriend and live-in roommate. Has the time come to move on, both physically and emotionally? Maybe something new would do him wonders. +David continues to work hard in both his work and establishing his life there in Poulsbo. He's gaining courage to do something impossible with high hopes of it being possible. However, it's unknown if it'll be a good idea in the end... --WARNINGS-- +The typical warnings: adult language, adult situations, adult nonsense.</td>
