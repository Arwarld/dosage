<th>Description</th><td>Hector never seems to want to leave Ruby alone. He's always there, bugging her and tracking her every move and she can't stand him much longer. Of course...she has to learn to live with it seeing as he isn't going anywhere. Afterall, he IS just that little voice in her head. Join the schizophrenic Ruby, her mute best friend and roommate Kenneth, their eccentric neighbor Lynn and a whole cast of oddball characters as they try to live through the everyday trials of moving out and living on your own...despite being a little messed up in the head.</td>
