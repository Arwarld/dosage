Though you don't see anything, putting that out there for people sensitive to such matters. Might offend you. Though the stuff is kind of dark it's not about depression. And I haven't been through the stuff the characters have gone through, I don't even know why I wrote about this. im gonna shut up now.</textarea></td>
