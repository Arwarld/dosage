<th>Description</th><td>After two years, a 16-year-old Charlie McDermott returns to his hometown and to his previous friends. Many things have changed, some things haven't. Old wounds will resurface, and new wounds will possibly appear as well. This isn't just a love story. This is a struggle to survive. A struggle to find an identity. Are you in the status quo of society or are you the embodiment of what the status quo isn't? Are you willing to show the world your true identity? (( romance (hetero + BL/shounen-ai) // drama/angst \\ comedy/humor ))</td>
