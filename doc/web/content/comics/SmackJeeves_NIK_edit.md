<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">The Character: Nikolai is a young mage who shows great potential. He is able to wield magic without using his hands or chanting words by using the light magic he has webbed around him at all times. The Plot: The world has forever been balanced between good and evil. Each mortal lying somewhere between the two extremes. Now that a new mage has taken over the council, the light beings have a burst of power which breaks the balance they have with the dark beings of the world. And they aren't willing to keep the balance, no, the mage council decides to use this power for all they can and wipe out every ounce of dark-energy in their section of the world... This balance being broken can change many things. The mortals are directly influenced by the energies! But wouldn't a world of pure light magic be a good thing? ... (This is a BL, yaoi, shounen ai, boy-love comic. With some Hetero.)</textarea></td>
