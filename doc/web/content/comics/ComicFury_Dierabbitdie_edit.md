<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Born in the backwoods of Oklahoma, Daisy Dew Mummolo lived a life of mystery her first few years. She was found in an abandoned house and spent some time at a rescue before Burt responded to her get-rich-quick scheme on Craigslist. She felt pity for him after cleaning out his bank account and decided to move in with him to console his constant spats of crying. Soon, they became friends, and Daisy allowed Burt to chronicle her daily life in exchange for baked chicken dinners, trips to the dog park, and custom made collars. Daisy loves children, tolerates adults, and absolutely hates rabbits. It's in her blood. Since the 1500's her breed has been raised to find rabbits. Unfortunately, Daisy has somehow twisted this tracking talent into a personal vendetta. She earnestly feels that rabbits are evil and must be hunted down and destroyed. As such, many in the rabbit community have taken exception to this attitude. Several restraining orders have been taken out against Daisy, but she simply chews them up the moment they're served. Each morning, she awakes with a smile on her face, a spring in her step, and a singular phrase in her mind, &quot;Die Rabbit, Die!&quot;</textarea></td>
