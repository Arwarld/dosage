<th>Description</th><td>Darren lived the charmed life of barhopping before he met Kale. It was a new guy every night, lots of drinking, lots of sex, etc. But when he snagged big, quiet Kale, Darren uncovered Kale's secret and set into motion a series of events that lead them both down a path no one expected. Warnings: first and foremost, very gay. Gay romance, gay sex, gay gay gay. If this isn't your cup of tea, you probably shouldn't bother continuing reading. Second, the occasional bad word. Third, booze. (Does booze require a warning? It's not underage drinking or anything.) Fourth; drama and cheeze out the wazoo. Fifth and final warning; very badly drawn. (And probably badly spelled, too.)</td>
