<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Ever made a comic that none notice? But do you think the comic would be very successful? Well, you just gotta advertise somewhere, maybe a multi-author comic, but that'll annoy other authors. NOT ANYMORE! In this comic, you can post as many advertisements as you like! Show others your comics, and watch comics from others! That way, everyone will be able to read the latest comics! Please only place advertisements for comics here. So no fillers, no bios, no spritesheets. Don't forget to add a link towards your comic profile in the comments section below the ad! We request that you read the rules &amp; guidelines section if you haven't done so already. Please don't be negative about comics in the comments, no one wants their ad to look bad. For those interested: Last author count: 465 authors (April 21st 2013)</textarea></td>
