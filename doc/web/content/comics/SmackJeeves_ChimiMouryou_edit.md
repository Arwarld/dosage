<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Near the top of one of Japan's many mountains away from all the human villages, there is a forest inhabited by youkai who are constantly learning how to deal with each other. Basically, &quot;The Daily Lives of Crazy Youkai&quot; This comic is a bunch of random short stories and not one continuous one. Everything is acted out in pantomime AKA there are no written words. Chimi mouryou can be roughly translated as &quot;evil monsters in the mountains and rivers&quot;. The legend of it keeps the forest safe from humans. I am still researching more about the Edo period and youkai, so I apologize for unintentional inaccuracies. For now, the updates for this comic are random. I apologize!</textarea></td>
