<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Panacea has the gift of healing, which makes her a target for both sides of a civil war. The Minister, leader of the Agency, is determined to have her cure his fatal illness and prolong his life. Forever. But the Gunman and his accomplices want her dead. All Panacea wants is to find her own destiny. When she and her bodyguard, Aegis, stumble upon Traver, who takes them in after they narrowly escape a brush with death, Panacea believes she may have found a real home. But the Agency has eyes everywhere, the Gunman is always waiting in the shadows, and Panacea can never be sure who her allies are.</textarea></td>
