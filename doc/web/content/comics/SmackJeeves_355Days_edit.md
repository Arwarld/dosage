<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">This was originally a comic where I attempted to make an homage to Kurt Vonnegut's Timequake, but it slowly evolved into A Dada Humor comic, which has now evolved onto a actual storyline that has gone on since April 1st 2012. This is my experimental comic where I attempt to post a comic daily with anything I can get my hands on, just attempting to get at least one page up! ***ENDED AS OF 9/2/12*** If you liked this comic check out my new comic: Euphemistic Eephus. http://www.smackjeeves.com/comicprofile.php?id=127121</textarea></td>
