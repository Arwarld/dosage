<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">So! Looking for a comic with spunky dragons? Yeah! Sexy cat-girls? YEAH! Evil empires? YEAH YEAH YEAH! Giant spiders? HELL YEAH! Death dealing assassins? OH YEAH! Annoying film critics? YE-ah, wait, what? Zeke Fahrenheit is, if you couldn't tell from the lame build-up, a film critic. And not just any film critic, a bad one (but that's redundant). Follow his crazy, mixed-up adventures as he tries to woo the princess (unsuccessfully), raise his daughter who happens to be a dragon (or is she raising him?) and just try to keep his sanity in a world where pop culture is not to be embraced but feared.</textarea></td>
