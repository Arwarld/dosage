<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Army Gags is a tale of friendship, love, loss, war and peace as seen through the eyes of an emotionally oblivious eight-year-old. Basically this is a comic I did over ten years ago that was apparently about people in the army. Reading through it as an adult, I realised just how unintentionally hilarious it could be. From exploding orphanage nuns to comic book industry-based slavery, Army Gags is truly a window into the somewhat uneasy mind of my eight-year-old self.</textarea></td>
