<th>Description</th><td>Updates Tuesdays and Thursdays. ------- Eight months have passed since the fight against Knuckles beneath South Island. Merlin and Charles, funded by Robotnik Enterprises, are now beginning their expedition to Angel Island. During the middle of a news conference, the Egg Carrier is attacked by a mysterious foe, but a familiar face. It's a race against time as Sonic and Tails must find a way up to Angel Island before the Egg Carrier is destroyed... and Charles and Merlin along with it! In a world covered by endless water, this is the Digger's Adventure Story in Halcyon days.</td>
