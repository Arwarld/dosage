<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">What happens when two small girls from either side of the war meet? What happens when they become best friends? Contested Territory is a story about just that; a young Orc named Thook and a rescued Night Elf with no memories named Kithra. Instantly inseparable, the girls face Azeroth together, testing the boundaries of friendship, family and faction as they learn what makes them so similar, yet so different. Raised by loving but cautious Auntie and Uncle, Aguul and Kross, as well as a dear tauren friend, Winthir, Thook and Kithra learn what happens when two enemies meet before they are old enough to understand hatred. This is a fan-based comic set in Azeroth, home of World of Warcraft. This comic was originally written in 2008, with the prologue, and chapters one and two taking place during Vanilla. The comic is done entirely by hand: pencil, pen, colored pencil, and scan. Currently, it uploads regularly on Tuesday mornings and Friday mornings. If you do not play WoW, the main thing that you need to know is the hatred between the two factions: the Horde, made up of Orcs, Tauren, Trolls, Undead and later Blood Elves and Goblins, and the Alliance, comprised of Humans, Dwarves, Night Elves, Gnomes and later Draenei and Worgen.
