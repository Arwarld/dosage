<th>Description</th><td>A comic about a young Yoshi, and his efforts to become a hero. To evolve, become something more than he was meant to be; little does he know, more people than he alone depend on this. I swear, it's better than it sounds. Not by a LOT but it IS. The Yoshi Herd. Wish I could say it's updated weekly, but... yeah. DISCLAIMER: While &quot;The Yoshi Herd&quot; itself would be considered somewhere between G and PG, I take no responsibility for any links to other sites or the comments of my readers. I have tried to moderate comments, and it all falls to pieces the instant I interfere. So... keep that in mind, I guess?</td>
