<th>Description</th><td>A comic about a young Yoshi, and his efforts to become a hero. To evolve, become something more than he was meant to be; little does he know, more people than he alone depend on this. I swear, it's better than it sounds. Not by a LOT but it IS. The Yoshi Herd. Wish I could say it's updated weekly - so I decided to start updating weekly! Every Wednesday, usually late at night - Australian time anyway - point is, there's roughly a six hour window every Wednesday where you might see it pop up. But, uh, keep it on the down-low. People might start EXPECTING it to update. As if it was MAKING A COMEBACK or something. So this? This is between you, and me. If you tell anyone - look, just don't tell anyone. You don't wanna know, capiche?</td>
