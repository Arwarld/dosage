<th>Description</th><td>UPDATES FRIDAYS~ Sometimes even more often! : o Christian and Liam are brothers going to the same prestigious high school. Christian has a big crush on one of his classmates, Tristan. Liam has one on Dominique. But, Dominique's twin brother, Colton has a thing for Liam. My goodness! Not only is there a ridiculous amount of gay and the drama of high school crushes and love triangles, there's also a little detail that has yet to be mentioned. Tristan, Dominique and Colton are only a few members of a large group of individuals keeping a huge secret. A secret that's full of power. But, the last time this secret got out, it put an end to many people's lives. This secret can not get out again. And there are some people who will make sure it won't. CONTENT ADVISORY: Online Comic will not contain anything visually explicit. There is cursing here and there and general sexuality. YES. BL. GAY. YAOI. WELL, MORE LIKE SHONEN-AI. ALSO SOME STRAIGHT. &lt;3</td>
