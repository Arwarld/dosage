<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">Welcome to the third installment of the spriter's showcase! RULES 1.Give credit for any and all sprite sheets. 2.Treat all other authors with respect. Critique is fine. Flaming isn’t. 3.Stick to a posting schedule. (Whatever works for you. Just don’t post one thing and go missing for a month.) 4.No adult content. 5. No recolors or very easy edits are to be posted, this rule is only in place to keep you from getting flamed/trolled. Recolors are looked down upon in this comic. 6. Spriters must have at least some experience with sprites before applying to join. If they do not, their application will be denied. 7. Flaming, spam, and arguing in the comments will not be tolerated, and will be deleted. If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, drop a PM my way. -Noland</textarea></td>
