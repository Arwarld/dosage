<th>Description</th><td>An accidental meeting turns Reimee's life up and down. She finds herself in the middle of an affair regarding enslaved demons, magical artefacts and many temptations of the modern world. Will she get tempted? Or will she be the one to tempt? And finally, will she find what she's looking for in the Eternal City of Rome? Inspired by eastern folklore, religion, Grimm tales and life itself, set in modern times Rome it's a paranormal action romance in which the borderline between good and evil is very thin. (plus guys don't sparkle and girls can kick your butt :D) NOTE: 1.This comic is fruit of immagination and does not reflect anyone's opinions nor real facts nor people. 2.Not marked mature (I find it annoying when I can't see the preview)but may contain some blood here and there and possibly some erotic scenes. 3.Commens are very appreciated. Reviewable if anyone wanted to attempt at it.</td>
