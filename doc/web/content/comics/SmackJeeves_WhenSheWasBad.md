<th>Description</th><td>For every story about a hero, there is a &quot;bad guy&quot;. Only, this story isn't about the hero. It's about the smart-alec, tough-as-nails villain. About her fights, her triumphs, her losses, her lackeys... And maybe her love life. If she can ever get the guts to ask the girl of her dreams out. (contains mostly yuri/GL and a bit of background het...Beware of foul language. It's mostly rated &quot;mature&quot; for violence and cursing. Sort of like an extremely f-d up reverse version of a magical girl story.) Read L-&gt;R, western style. For now, due to my work schedule, updates will be on either Sunday or Monday, sometimes both. This is subject to change, since my schedule/days off changes every few months. A lot of the shading from Interlude 1 and #13 done by Jovat. &lt;3 Sidenote... This comic is not for horny guys hoping to see &quot;HOTT LESBO ACTION ZOMG!!!11ONE&quot; Yes, the main character happens to be a lesbian. But this story is about the plot, not &quot;porn&quot;.</td>
