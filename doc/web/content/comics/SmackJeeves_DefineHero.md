<th>Description</th><td>A series of adventures staring an evil cat witch, her &quot;evil&quot; minion dragon and their hero...named Hero...who has no idea who...or what he is. Thinking they struck it rich by finding a god-like being that can do what ever they command him to do, Gaffy and Dragon take Hero in as part of their group. As Hero travels with them, however, his instinct to do innocent good deeds such as rescuing pretty damsels, returning lost keys or fighting a monster or two leads them into epic...and sometimes hilarious (mis)adventures. Read from left to right Updates often (2-3 times a week) Accepts ideas for story arcs and spin offs! Comic banner by AnnaLena250199 on Deviant Art! http://annalena250199.deviantart.com/</td>
