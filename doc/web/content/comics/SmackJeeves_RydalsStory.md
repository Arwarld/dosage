<th>Description</th><td>A story loosely based off of Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio. -------------------------------------------- Robert Rydal, an optimistic and semi-incompetent, fake-it-till-you-make-it conman recruits an unsuspecting (and partially unwilling) crew of people to aid his quest of finding the Blue Fairy to lift the Donkey Curse he had received as a child. What price would you pay to get your life back? ----------------------- Updates normally over the weekend...Unless it doesn't...But mostly it does. :) Check the Twitter Feed for live page updates!</td>
