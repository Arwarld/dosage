<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">I started this comic a little over a year ago, and it's been going strong ever since. Taking place in the 3rd pass of Pernese history, K'mlar, a young genius Masterweaver was placed at Ista Weyr as his first appointment after being given the station of Master. There he impresses a young Gold hatchling, an event completely unheard of in Pernese history. Despite being aggressively anti-social, he manages to make a place for himself at the Weyr that he never would have dreamed possible.</textarea></td>
