Dosage comic SmackJeeves/Skeptical
-----------------------------------------

<table class="comicinfo">
<tr>
<th>Description</th><td>A regular slice of life/death romantic comedy about an unusual family and their relations to a group of creatures that call themselves &quot;skull people&quot;. Said human family is not mine. The Clark family(and half the comic itself) was created by and belongs to TyrannicalShipper. Just a warning- there's an abundance of foul language, and occasional bloodshed. Constructive critiques are always appreciated! (Updates sporadically due to the fact that we are both now in college)</td>
