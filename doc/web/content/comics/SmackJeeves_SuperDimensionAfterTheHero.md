<th>Description</th><td>Updates once every weekend. (Mondays count as weekend.) Super-Dimension comics are just the name I give all my superhero comics. This has no relation to any other Super-Dimension comics. Dennis Lockham was Paladin. A guardian superhero of L.A. But now his powers are gone. He's just a man. And that is the one thing he can't take on. Rated 12+ for *&amp;%$'ed cussing, and violence. Neither of much, though.</td>
