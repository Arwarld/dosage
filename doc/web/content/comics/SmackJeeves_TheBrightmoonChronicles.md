<th>Description</th><td>Heimr. A world ruled by Monarchies, Academies and the Guilds. In a bid to gain supremacy in the world, Caelum Academy sends two brothers to find two ancient artifacts. These artifacts were said to be forged by the Gods of old who once ruled Heimr and said to contain the ancient powers and knowledge of these Gods. And with the sudden disappearance of their father, Maximilian and Lucas Gabriel are in way over their heads. Updates on Fridays. (Normally colour. Black and white for the moment though)</td>
