<th>Description</th><td>&lt;&gt;Set roughly 20-30 years after Twilight Princess.&lt;&gt; The return of not one, but two villains has a young, unwilling hero scrambling across the land of Hyrule in search of power enough to defeat them. Reluctant at first to accept his fate, tiny steps taken along with a guiding hand (or two) will help mold just the savior Hyrule needs. || Incorporates a little bit of TP, FS, MC?, and... probably a few others I'm forgetting right off the bat. Legend of Zelda belongs to Nintendo, not me.</td>
