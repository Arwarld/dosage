<table class="comicinfo">
<tr>
<th>Description</th><td>Sakari Kauria has been living the humble life of a show bartender for a few years. His life isn't glamorous, but when he isn't too self-aware about the quirks in his appearance, it's good enough. He knows who he is, and he knows how the cogwheels of the world run... Except he really doesn't. Luckily during one chaotically eventful night, he encounters Lucifer. A youngster with a similar twist in his appearance, who knows a lot more about the world they live in, and a few answers to some questions about Sakari himself that have plagued him ever since he knew he wasn't like the rest of his kind.</td>
