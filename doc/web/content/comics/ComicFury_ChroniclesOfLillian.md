<th>Description</th><td>Lillian is an average 14-year old girl—not especially talented or pretty or noticed by anyone. It’s just another boring day until a rainstorm sends her into the house of Old Warren, a mysterious and kind elder. He offers to tell her stories of adventure every day, and Lillian accepts. But as the days continue and Lillian grows a bond with Old Warren, she will soon find that she’ll never have a boring day again. (Updates every Sunday)</td>
