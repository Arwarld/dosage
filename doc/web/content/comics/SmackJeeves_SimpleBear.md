<th>Description</th><td>Bear Copenhagen is just a simple bear and nothing else. Spoiler: Not for long. Simple Bear is an action packed, supernatural thrill ride that uses words like this in the summary to make people want to read it. Also this comic features cartoon animals, not &quot;furries.&quot; Just thought I'd throw that out there. Updates every 2 days</td>
