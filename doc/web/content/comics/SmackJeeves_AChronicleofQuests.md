<th>Description</th><td>Created for the soul purpose of fighting in a tournament for the gods, Heroic Guy has it pretty rough. In addition to being the champion of the three weakest gods in the world he seems to be on the top of every other mortal champions hit-list. Can he level grind enough to emerge victorious? Probably not. But hey, it could be amusing anyways.</td>
