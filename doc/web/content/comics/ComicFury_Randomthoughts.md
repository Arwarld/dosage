<th>Description</th><td>Yeah so this really is random thoughts. I woke up one morning thinking about a duck-sausage and I figured I might as well start doing a webcomic about things. Yes..Things. Stuff and junk and stuff that happens to me. And things. It's mostly sort of an online diary, except also not. It's just random thoughts. I apologize for dry humor, bad puns and possible injuries you suffer from facepalming. However, I hope you enjoy :D</td>
