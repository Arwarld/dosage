<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">This is a comic of a lot of nerdy pop-culture stuff such as internet memes, Naruto, RP characters, Pokemon, and.... Kirby. The whole story is LOOSELY based on Kirby and the Amazing Mirror. IMPORTANT: COMICS ARE READ RIGHT TO LEFT. THAT MEANS THAT &quot;LATEST COMIC&quot; IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST AND &quot;FIRST COMIC&quot; IS ACTUALLY THE LATEST. Kotaru, Kyousuke, and Riki were best friends since childhood and continued to be into high school, until one of their ordinary, normal days goes wrong and changes their life forever... They team up with Kirby and create the S.W.O.R.D to fight against the Dark Knight. Thanks for reading and please feel free to comment.
