<th>Description</th><td>Hemlock #1 and #2 are now available to buy online! each issue is priced at £6 plus postage and packing. they can be bought through lulu.com at my storefront here: http://stores.lulu.com/mildtarantula lulu accepts both card and paypal. since they go straight from lulu to you, they will not be signed or anything like that. if you happen to see me at one of the conventions i will be attending, i will be selling them for £5 each and i'll be happy to sign them and do a little sketch for you if you like.</td>
