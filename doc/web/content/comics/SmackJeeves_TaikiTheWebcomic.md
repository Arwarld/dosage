<th>Description</th><td>FINISHED! Taiki is a typical shy 16 year old high school student who is starting the 10th grade with her best friend Nikki. Going into the 2nd half of high school, Taiki thinks it’s strange that she has never liked someone or fallen in love. One day she unexpectedly meets someone who changes all of this. However this person turns out to be a girl! Taiki has always wanted to know what it was like to fall in love, but what she didn’t expect was that finding out would also be a journey of self discovery, realizing her sexuality, and maybe even heartbreak. -IMPORTANT!!- This is a mirror of my own website, check it out if you want to see more artwork --&gt; http://www.taikiwebcomic.com/ This comic was started in 2006, so the art in the beginning isn't very good compared to what it is now. This story contains GL and HL, it is MOSTLY GIRL LOVE THOUGH.</td>
