<th>Description</th><td>It's said that a child's heart is pure like a plain white sheet of paper, and what's written on it will define the child in the future. Amadeus 'Raven' Alistair, was a sweet boy and a loving son, but his heart and life drastically changed after the arrival of new family members. This is a story of love and hatred. Revenge and secrets. Note : - Mature Content Category for the Dark themes - This is my personal project for practice, so there may be different styles specially of finishings that you may find as inconsistency. But aside of that, i'm doing this project with my heart, i'll try my best to make a good story and decent art to read and enjoy. - Supportive and constructive reviews and criticisms are very much appreciated :) Peace, Vdtitian</td>
