<th>Description</th><td>The story takes place in the 1920s in a lovely small town called Ventura, in Brazil. Its economic growth depends on a local chocolate factory called Bombom, which is very famous for its chocolate. Ana Francisca is a beautiful young girl, but she is from a poor family. She hides her beauty with big glasses, old hairstyle, and outdated clothing. She lost her parents not too long ago and moved to Ventura to live with her other family members. In that family, there are her Grandma Carmen, Uncle Margarido, Cousins Marcia and Timothy, and Dalia, who was accepted into the family. Ana helps out at home until she is accepted a job to work as a janitor at the Chocolate Factory after school. There she meets Ludovico, the factory owner who pretends to be one of the workers at the factory. Ludovico returns to Ventura to investigate his greedy sister Jezebel, who lives like a queen after taking over the factory. While Ana's in Ventura, she falls in love with Danilo, the town's flirt who has dated almost every girl in town. However, his main love interest is the beautiful girl, Olga. Although he says he never fall in love, will that possibly change after meeting Ana Francisca?</td>
