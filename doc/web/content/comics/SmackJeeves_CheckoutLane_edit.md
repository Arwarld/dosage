<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">Ever worked in retail? Then I'm sure you'd remember all the crazy things that happened around your work place. Checkout Lane centers around Mandy, a cashier, and the crazy events that occur around Little Bit of Italy (a grocery store that specializes in Italian goods). Some of them have really happened to me and some I did just for humor's sake. But you never know! They could really happen! Happy reading everyone!</textarea></td>
