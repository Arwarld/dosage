<th>Description</th><td>[Outlawed] is the story and events of DJ, who longs to be a webcomic artist(or an artist in anything for that matter). He lives in Waldorf, Maryland and it is not exactly the best place to try to get his talent showcased. So DJ has to enlist the help of his friends,who share common ideals but in truth they are only there for the video games and free gear. Even still, DJ has to face the drama and the crap that is thrown at him daily but with video games and heavy metal music there's no telling what will happen to DJ and his friends.
