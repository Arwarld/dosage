<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">A thousand or so years in the future, humanity rests in the palms of two companies. Unknowingly living in a world that could easily collapse and an outside world of vast nothingness. From here we shall mainly focus on two young people; Code Chestock and Dominic Eode as they shift through the world learning its secrets. I try to update every Friday through Sunday and maybe on some other random day, because why not? basically I update whenever I finish a page. So if that means updating everyday, twice a day, or after a long period of time, let it happen. I will take helpful critique for this comic as well, because I know it needs a lot of work.</textarea></td>
