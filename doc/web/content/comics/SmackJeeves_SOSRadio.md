Chainsaw Adam's, a lone pirate radio dj travels a post apocalyptic wasteland broadcasting a message of rebellion. Calling to the abstract souls and the free spirits, he inspires those in hiding from the powers that be to rise up and fight back to create a new society built on the stuff that dreams are made of. &quot;CLIFF-NOTES FOR NEW VIEWERS&quot; After breaching the city walls of Tulsa, Chainsaw finds Rockette, the sister of the woman he seeks &quot;The Girl with Green Eyes&quot; AKA (Quill). Ready to venture to the prison to rescue her, the two find themselves confronted by re-animated robots bent on destruction. Can Chainsaw's abilities as a 'Natural' save them!? WHY READ? Read BEFORE we become popular. THEN when your friends start reading too, you can say &quot;Hey I've been reading for years, suck it!</td>
