<th>Description</th><td>A romance fan comic, based on the 1980's animated Beetlejuice series. Beetlejuice and Lydia were the best of friends. They did absolutely everything together and were always there for each other. So Beetlejuice never considered the idea that they would ever be separated. That is, until Lydia starts growing up and begins to call upon him less and less. Then, eventually cuts ties with him completely, leaving poor Beetlejuice lonely and confused. He remains loyal and waits for her call. 30 years later, Beetlejuice is suddenly called upon once more. But it's not his dear Lydia.... It's her daughter! But where is Lydia? Can Beetlejuice cope with why she stopped calling all those years ago? Will a romance bloom between Lydia's daughter and Beetlejuice? Find out!
