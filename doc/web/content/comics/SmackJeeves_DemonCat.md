<th>Description</th><td>Hello Everyone! Yes, i have made me another webcomic - but this one will be very different compared to the others. I have already finished this comic... during class (in school... ) and now i'm just outlining it on photoshop, to make it look better. But i will be updating everything maybe 12 pages at a time? But not that much because it is a very short story... and as i've said... this is my first story... that is BL... so I wanted to tell everyone just so you guys no, that its not an intense BL... just a little sprinkle of it... i was just very curious to try it out... and i think it came out good... Anyway, i wanted to show it to you guys - Cause you're AWESOME! xD ~~~~ The story is about a Demon who runs away to Earth but finds out that he's turned into a cat... and finds that he's liking it. As well as the human who takes care of him, but his human's (master) friend is jealous and starts to develop plans to get rid of the cat. ~~~~~~ Warning: BL (not that much though) WARNING: SHORT STORY!</td>
