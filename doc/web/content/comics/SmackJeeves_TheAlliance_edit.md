<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">The year is 3010... The earth has become a poisoned shadow of what it once was. The sky has stained red, a symbol of the endless wars that had emerged below. Animals mutated from the toxic atmosphere that own the lands. Mankind itself has even been mutated. For some, their DNA being matched with various animals. And others gaining different attributes from their darkening hearts. Human kind has now fled to giant toxin purified domes. But even this is beginning to become less then what they need to survive. Their minds have been polluted with evil. Darkness surrounds their hearts. Now there is only one hope........ The Alliance. Contains Violence, blood, romance... Eventually... My comic is BOYXGIRL.</textarea></td>
