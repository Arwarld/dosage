<th>Description</th><td>Most stories have good guys and bad. Some have only good guys, but with antagonists. Then some have only dastardly villains trying to do villainous things to decent people while all along screaming at the top of their lungs into the rain. This is one of those comics This is also a very depressing comic. Seriously. Every chapter is 'death' in a different language, and each title page is the Protagonist about to die. ... I told you it was depressing. Anyways, don't let that stop you! It takes place 20 years in the future. The U.S. has deteriorated into a kind of middle-ages scenario, where the government is corrupt, inflation rules, and the Mafia basically control the country. It doesn't get any better than that. But Isaac, the commander of the NY Mafia, notices there's a new gang in town. The Redblades. And there's something familiar about the commander... I'd rate it about 12+. There's mild gore, blood, and violence. Also comic cussing (!@#$%^&amp; it!). And it's basically aimed at an older audiance, but if you're okay with the above, go ahead.</td>
