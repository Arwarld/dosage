<th>Description</th><td>Warning: YAOI, which means man on man action in bed. There will be graphic scenes later on in the story. There are also suggestive scenes as well. Also abuse. Please leave now if any of this bothers you. That's all. (and if you are looking for instant gratification, this probably isn't the story for you) Everything was normal....ish. It was just Kain and his mom against the cold cruel world. That was normal for them. At least, it was until his old friend comes back into Kain's life. Milo abruptly confronts Kain after years of being apart, but Kain doesn't remember his past and turns him away. Even after multiple times of Kain trying to push Milo away, Milo won't let go of his childhood crush. Will Milo finally break down the wall blocking Kain's memories and gain his love? Or will he let his love go because someone else already has taken his place? (art gets better as time goes. 2008-present) (This story is pre-planned from start to finish.) Attempting to update every sunday UPDATES RANDOMLY (deal with it) :D</td>
