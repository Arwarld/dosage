<th>Description</th><td>Quickening: the ability to manifest your soul energy in the form of a weapon. --- Tony Lockhart is a senior student who attends one of the most prestigious schools in the country: Rowan Academy, which is known for its discerning methods of teaching the art of Quickening and combat. Every day he faces giant robots, giant reptiles, rabid fangirls (but not HIS fangirls), sadistic teachers, and anything that can put him in a life-or-death situation. All for the greater cause. Or so they say. But, really, he just wants to graduate with all his limbs intact. -- READ RIGHT TO LEFT</td>
