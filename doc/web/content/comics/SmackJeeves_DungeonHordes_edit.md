<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">In 1986 Dungeon Hordes was released on the Playtendo and moved 1 million units world wide which is way more successful than its previous release on the Batari 2200 in 1979. Now in 2011 Dungeon Hordes has returned bigger and better than ever with mind numbing graphics and all new enemies to fight. So how do the characters in game feel about this? Only time will tell. Enter the lives of Tiggz and Tomes, two level 5 bosses tired of being easily killed by player 1 and wanting the glory of finally becoming more than just petty bandits. Will they survive the new creatures that the mighty programmers have added to the game? Will they ever kill player 1 and move up the mob boss ladder? Will they ever get a raise from their uptight dungeon boss Kalakis and finally pay off their ale tabs at the Stinky Dragon Inn? Stay tuned and find out..... Will be updated Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Dungeon Hordes Facebook http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dungeon-Hordes#!/pages/Dungeon-Hordes/195568970460655</textarea></td>
