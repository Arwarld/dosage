<th>Description</th><td>Caelen is part shapeshifter but his dual heritage becomes a curse when he learns his unstable body is slowly deteriorating. Life seems pretty miserable and pointless. With no faith in himself and even less faith in others he has very much sunken into pitiful state. After hitting his lowest point, landing in the streets with nowhere to be, he manages to catch the attention of a stranger. Will Sairys' compassion and cheerful attitude be enough to break through the barriers Caelen manage to erect around himself? *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ Boy Love Warning! Hopefully I'll manage to update once a week. You can expect new pages on Mondays and Thursdays... usually, unless something comes up and I can't make the deadline.</td>
