<th>Description</th><td>It seems the rapture has finally come- although it's a little different than expected. Heaven and Hell have come out of hiding and collapsed into the earth- making it one place. With them have come the demons of Hell and the angels of Heaven. If they're here, then who's to say God and the Devil haven't arrived on Earth as well? A race starts to find either one, a race to the end of the world, and caught in the middle of it are a couple of dumb kids. Featuring a cast of familiar names such as Lucifer, Lilith, Metatron, and a lot more. Rated Mature for drug use.</td>
