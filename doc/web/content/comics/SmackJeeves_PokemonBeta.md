<th>Description</th><td>The Trygon facility was made to create better Pokémon that can survive in their world, as species over the years have been dying out. Rymadanas, the head of the Red tower, desire Pokémon to become equals, with no weaknesses or be disadvantaged. Pokémon are recruited into the facilities by force if they lack the necessary amount of specimen. The Trygon capture Pokemon and genetically experiment on them, and even themselves to achieve their goals. Those captured unwillingly are wiped of their memories, forcing them to obey without question. Some regions had seen the only way out is to urge their residents to undergo experimentation to keep families from being separated, and body counts low. Opposition to the Trygon Organization has reached an all time pitfall. Only few pieces of land are still free of the shadow cast from the buildings. Is risky science the way to salvation? What is the root cause of Pokemon to be dying out? Unbeknownst to a Totodile, he would find the answers to everything...</td>
