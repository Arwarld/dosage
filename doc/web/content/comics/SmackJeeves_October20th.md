<th>Description</th><td>10 years ago, on October the 20th, 6 people from different parts of the globe were each responsible to taking an innocent life. Every anniversary following it, they have been stalked and hunted by a mysterious creature that only shows itself on the infamous date. Only the American called Catherine and the Argentinian called Rai are left. Is this the year they finally discover the truth about the curse that has taken everything from them, and find a way to stop the relentless beast? And who is the shadowy figure oddly called Shields McKloskey, who seems to hold all the answers?</td>
