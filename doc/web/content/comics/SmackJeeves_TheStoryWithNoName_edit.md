<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">#TW:Self Harm Have you ever died repeatedly because of a misunderstanding and a plot to take over the world? Conner Has. Now lets see where the streets of Depression takes us. (SWNN is a big learning opportunity to discover the rights and wrongs in comic design as well as composition, coloring, and stylistics. As the aesthetics of SWNN progress further in the story so will the personalities of the characters, so please pardon their blandness, predictability and plain boring nature. I promise you they will become not lame dumbfucks further on. The Story with No Name is a BIG complex creature that I've designed to teach very personal lessons on how not to be a huge dick.)</textarea></td>
