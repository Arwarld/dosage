<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">A tale of unending confusion, aggravation, adoration, and exclamation. Amanda's best friend just got dumped. How else to win her ex back than by pretending to date Amanda? Meanwhile, playboy of the school Zach has discovered he's rather bored toying with all the girls who fawn over him. After kissing Amanda's brother Leonard on a dare, he decides to do some follow up; he wants to know if he is so hot a guy would fall for him. Luckily for him, Leonard's already interested in his gender. Less work for Zach! In case you can't tell, it's full of gay kids. There's like, three straight kids total. If that doesn't float your boat, don't rock mine. Updates every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I'm also offering commissions to help keep myself alive.</textarea></td>
