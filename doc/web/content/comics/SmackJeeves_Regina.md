<th>Description</th><td>'Regina' is a sketch comic. It's a daily sketch challenge comic designed to get me to draw one comic page a day so I can stay in practice everyday. Also to practice page layouts and conversational writing. Regina is drawn using only a black ball-point pen and totally free-hand. The story of Regina is a slice of life about a girl named Regina and her random group of friends,where what ever happens, happens and I try to make it as interesting as possible. Updates: Daily</td>
