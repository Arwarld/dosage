<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">The upcoming J-rock band Battle-X balances on the brink of despair. And the cause of all this mess is the vocalist Rin Kawatake, who just can't seem to get a hold of his behaviour. When another bandmember leaves the band for the fifth time this year, the bandmanager puts his last hope into the new guitarist, named Teika Yoshida, the guy who just could be the solution to all of their problems! But not only that.. Because when they meet for the first time, Rin immediately seems to take a very special interest into this cute guy... YAOI/BL!! :3 updates a few times a week (I used to update everyday but... yeah, school's a bitch)</textarea></td>
