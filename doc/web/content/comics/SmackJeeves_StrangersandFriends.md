<th>Description</th><td>The small English town of Wootton Bassett begins to be haunted by a series of mysterious and horrific murders! Hemu, a new-comer to the town, becomes an obvious and easy target to the local community- he does have his fair share of secrets! But what secrets are the other locals hiding? A comic about the peculiar prejudices and customs of small communities, with a hint of social commentary on modern Britain, and a sinister splash of horror ;)</td>
