<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">For most current pages see Witch's Quarry at Mangamagazine.net. http://www.mangamagazine.net/manga-and-comics/Witchs-Quarry/detail-page/357?lang=en Currently Updating Here Tuesdays and Thursdays This is the tale of Sir Veolynn Moreshire's greatest and strangest achievement. Fate would have her/him led by the whims of a powerful witch. This is what really happened in the Second Great War for Oladuan; when heroes and villains were neither righteous or evil. There were other hidden creatures that placed high stakes in the outcome of the human's conflict. And there were a great many funny things that just didn't go as planned. All's fair game in love, war and species propagation! Rated PG-13 *warning* some adult situations/humor/GLBT themes Rogue X Knight Intermission short story of Wesyng Reedle meets a man who shares the same face, Sir Deshad Bright. Suggested age +16 for mature themes.</textarea></td>
