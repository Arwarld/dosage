<th>Description</th><td>READ LEFT TO RIGHT -------------&gt; It's not about bloody stuff and it's not about emos. I gave the guy with the black hair long hair because before, I had trouble drawing 2 eyes and making them even =_= so I covered one of them lol. Well he looks kinda cool like that, so all's good. Hale is a random dude in school, who sucks terribly at school subjects, but works hard enough to pass his classes with decent grades. Having -red- hair, bullies tease him, but Hale's bluntness strikes back at them. Milo is another random dude in school, who does well in school, (not effortlessly, though) He's an optimistic fool who has had a &quot;hobby&quot; since an incident that happened 2 years ago, and the &quot;hobby&quot; reawakens. No smut/No p0rn Just shounen ai Art gradually gets better lol.</td>
