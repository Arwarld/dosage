<th>Description</th><td>Blinder Foxes are widely feared as ferocious beasts, an evil that parallels man. Yet as the not-so-young fox called Whisper finds out, every life has its limits. Beaten down and broken, he is saved by a equally damaged young woman who calls herself &quot;Howl&quot;. The two unite under the common goal of revenge but do two broken souls truly make one whole? Meanwhile, a millennia long storm called &quot;The Silver&quot; is tearing the world apart - the answer to a question that no one seems to know.</td>
