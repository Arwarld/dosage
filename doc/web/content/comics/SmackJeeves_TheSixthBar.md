<th>Description</th><td>The war between Del-Naaj and Saam-Sara has ended, but Nero knows otherwise. A false peace has been created by the Del-Naajan fear of the Saam-Saran psychics. Torn by the death of his close companion Lynn, Nero has trained for the past six years, sharpening his skills so that he may better protect his city. But a plot is brewing: a plot that will rekindle hostilities between the two cities.</td>
