<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">A young prince who comes from a bloodline of dragon slaying, world saving heroes, is an absolute scaredy cat, who feels hopeless in living up to his family name. But he didn't know that his ancestors had the advantage of a sword that can alter time. When his crush gets kidnapped by a dragon, he unknowingly wields this sword, mans up with a little help from a stranger with a turban, and sets off on an adventure to save the supposed damsel in distress. But he'll soon find out that dragons don't account for the smallest fraction of the trouble this kingdom is in.</textarea></td>
