<th>Description</th><td>Basically a BL story like &quot;the prince and the pauper&quot; No sex scenes (at least not for a hundred pages or so) Mostly a cute story about a developing relationship (may have smexxy scenes depending upon how much courage I have) Aki was abandoned when he was eight, for ten years he's lived on the streets with nothing but his wits and strength to support him. Needless to say he is unhappy. But one day he runs into some one who looks exactly like him! This mysterious boy turns out to be the young master of a large corporation who just wants to be free and discover himself. Aki and this mysterious boy trade lives for the summer and Aki's doing fine in his new life until his identity is discovered by the mysterious boy's intimidating body guard named Kaidou. Can a love bloom between a stoic individual and a street rat? Edit: even though it says &quot;mature content&quot; nothing mature worthy happens for awhile &gt;_&gt; Just something I thought you should know :3</td>
