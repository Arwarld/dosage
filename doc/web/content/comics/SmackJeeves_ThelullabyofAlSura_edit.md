<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">The story of &quot;The Lullaby of Al'Sura&quot; follows the life of the young half-Tar'Suja girl Duhliya, trying to find her place in the city of Al'Sura, a capital city of the tarsujan race, in which most half-bloods are rather frowned upon. Born with a inherited disease called Oblivion, a sickness similar to Alzheimer, with many of her childhood memories long forgotten, she grew up under the care of her foster-mother and teacher Tzenarra. When Keehva, a former friend of her deceased mother and friend of Tzenarra, makes his appearance in the academy, she slowly starts regaining lost memories, and starts to discover the reasons why a half-blood like her was allowed to stay under the care of the council of Al'Sura</textarea></td>
