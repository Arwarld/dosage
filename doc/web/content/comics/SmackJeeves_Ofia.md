<th>Description</th><td>Ofia is what has grown from a small group helping people hundreds of years ago to a huge organization that has taken over the whole valley. They do anything the people want them to do against money, which they need to keep their members alive and kicking. Ofia strives to be not a working place, but a home to its members. While Ofia is still recovering from a fight that took place five years ago, a stray cat full of hate towards the organization gets pulled in. What happens next?</td>
