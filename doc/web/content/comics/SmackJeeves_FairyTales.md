<th>Description</th><td>Forced to move to a new town, 15-year-old Kiki Manders has been given a much-needed chance to start her life over. However, that's not so easy when your family thinks you're crazy. Kiki's certainly does, and maybe they're right. After all, her best friend is a fairy that nobody else can see. And that's the LEAST of her worries. Family trauma, high school drama, and the paranormal; Kiki's life may not be easy, but at least it's never dull.</td>
