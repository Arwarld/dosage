<th>Description</th><td>With the disappearance of her husband and her life dwindling to nothing, Celeste begins her quest to not only reclaim the fervor of her life but to also tangle with the now unfurling chaos that has consumed her being. This fledgling Descendant, with the most powerful relic on earth, finds herself violently hunted by those whose lives stretch back to antiquity. Can she come to terms with the revelation that the whole of humanity knows literally nothing about the nature of their existence and can she muster within herself the will to thwart the anger of an ancient god?</td>
