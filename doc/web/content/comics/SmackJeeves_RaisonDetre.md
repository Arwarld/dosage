<th>Description</th><td>When flamboyant Brit Alastair moved to America, he thought he'd accomplish a little more than setting up a failing pizza take away business after his Harvard education. After being deemed unable to have children, neither did be believe his pipe dream of starting a family would ever be possible. However following many odd twists of fate, he finds himself being the legal guardian of four children/adolescents each with their own unique quirks and of course, problems. But despite his best efforts, following a devastating accident, he finds it incredibly difficult to function within the busy New York lifestyle, let alone tackle four children alone. After being confronted with his first genuine Italian applicant for the new chefs job, could Luca Giovanni be the most complex new addition to this dysfunctional family? And what could be the reason behind Alastair's unhealthy attachment to him? Comedy / Drama / Slice of life / Romance &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Read this way &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</td>
