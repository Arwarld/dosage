<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">&quot;INSPIRED BY ABBIMAYS RANDOMNESS (now Void Misadventures, go there while you're on the internet)! AUTHOR RULES: 1. AUTHORS MUST UPDATE AT LEAST ONCE EVERY MONTH. If you won't be able to update, please PM me saying why, and you'll be pardoned if I believe your reason is valid. 2. SWEARING IS WRONG. It's okay if you censor it, but this is a rule that I expect to be followed in comics, comments, and chat. 3. TREAT OTHERS WITH RESPECT. I don't care who you are or what you said, BE NICE. If you were joking around, I'll understand. Any violation of these rules will result in a warning. Three warnings, no matter what the combination, and you will be kicked with an explanation why. You will have one oppourtunity to rejoin, but that will be it. Otherwise, that's it. Be safe and have fun. ~Melody-Pika, manager can we still puts things here mels ~Kurrokurro</textarea></td>
