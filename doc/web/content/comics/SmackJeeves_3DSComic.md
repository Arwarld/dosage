<th>Description</th><td>All this is made on a 3DS, so expect miis, qr codes, and doodles from the notepad. I also take pictures of my hand-drawn stuff, which usually look better than the notes. All non-contributing co-authors have been reset. I am now more serious about doing this comic, and as such will only allow authors who continually provide regular content.</td>
