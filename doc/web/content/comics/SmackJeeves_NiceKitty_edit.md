<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">UPDATES TUESDAY, THURSDAY,and SATURDAY! About Nice Kitty: It is the touching coming of age story of a young boy and his cuddly feline companion, trying to find love and acceptance in a world fraught with peril and harsh realities. Will the mysterious new friend they meet one fateful day be able to answer the call of their lonely hearts, and bring some life and color to their otherwise blue and lonely world? You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll pray for it to stop, but It won't because you can't stop the rock and why are you still reading this? You came to read the comic so READ already. This drivel certainly won't help you understand the story any better. Get going! And just remember: Be nice to your kitty, and he'll be NICE to you..........</textarea></td>
