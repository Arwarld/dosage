Now, Digimon are being corrupted by the mysterious Virus Cores, and the very data making up the Digital World is falling apart. BlackWarGreymon and his mysterious master are accelerating the process. Meanwhile, the soldiers of the Daemon Corps have begun moving their own plans forward. The whole world is in a state of chaos...
