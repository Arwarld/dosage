<th>Description</th><td>ISH doesn't know what he is looking for, but he knows there's something more;perhaps it was because of the fiery sword, perhaps it was because of HOP, perhaps it was because of that man who told him that there will be a day when everything will change. Really? The place he lives in is already forgotten by time, nothing here is alive, can anything be changed? =========================== Done in traditional art Fantasy with monsters and stuff... I'm bad at describing things... I'm bad with technology i know not how to do things and I'm still changing things around update weekly..hopefully...</td>
