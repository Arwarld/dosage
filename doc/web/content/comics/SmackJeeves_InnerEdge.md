<th>Description</th><td>&quot;Inner Edge: Old Wounds&quot; is a prologue to the core Inner Edge story that I hope to put in a webcomic form sometime in the future. However, there are aspects of storytelling and art that I would like to experiment with before that and other sorts of stories that I want to tell in a short story form. So I decided to post some of those short stories here. Hope you will enjoy ^__^ More info/illustrations on my website: www.tacto.deviantart.com</td>
