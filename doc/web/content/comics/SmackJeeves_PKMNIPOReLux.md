<th>Description</th><td>This takes place 30 years after the events in the PKMN anime and mangas. Battling and Contests competitions went to the international level letting trainers and coordinators to show their skills to the world. 1) Battles - In order for a trainer to qualify for the world finals, they must defeat 8 ultimate gym leaders. These gym leaders are tougher than all the Elite Four groups and champions in the PKMN world. 2) Contests - A coordinator can only qualify if they have a perfect record and within the 30 years a lot of these kind of people have popped up. Story: One of the IPO gym leaders is stepping down and the successor in currently a gym leader in training in Shinou or so you think...! --- *Disclaimer: This is a fan-comic crossover and the characters that are from other medias belong to their respective owners and not me. *Also any apologies for making you confused...which will be most likely be the case... *Read Right to Left &lt;----------- *And apologies for any inconsistent mass uploading of comics as I am ....very inconsistent...
