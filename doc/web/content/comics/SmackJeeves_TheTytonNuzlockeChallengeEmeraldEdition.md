<th>Description</th><td>[Working on: Page 526] Kids, I'm going to tell you a story. The story of how I... no, wait. Sorry. Welcome to the Tyton Nuzlocke Challenge, a character-driven graphic novel created entirely in Microsoft Paint. It updates daily, including weekends, holidays, and apocalypses (apocalypsi?). In a world overrun with eager trainers, the Pokemon Administration has taken desperate measures to ensure the remaining wild Pokemon survive, while allowing trainers to continue their paths. This has resulted in the limiting of catching wild Pokemon, the banning of certain items, and finally--the closing of Pokemon Resurrection Stations in all Pokemon Centers. Enter Tyton. He's thirteen and has less than a year to get all the way to the Pokemon League. Join him and his team as they follow the road to the Elite Four, get wrapped up in the schemes of Teams Aqua and Magma, and (possibly) uncover the mystery of Scott the poofy-haired stalker. There's also a Latin ladies' man Lombre, a swagalicious Gloom, a Numel that hates everyone he's ever met, a firecracker of a Whismur, and the most lovable Dustox you've ever seen. But we'll get to that.</td>
