<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">A comic based on the game &quot;The World Ends with You&quot;. Authors can assume the position of Players (good guys) or Reapers (bad guys). Players must win the Reaper's Game to return to the real world. A fierce struggle between pure souls and bringers of death begins! ***RULES*** 1. Your sprite must be humanoid. This applies to everyone, even demons. 2. If you are a Player, and you decide to introduce yourself after Day 1 of the current week, please, I cannot stress this enough, PLEASE do not make your comic seem as if you are starting off on Day 1. For example, you cannot say &quot;Oh, where am I?&quot; or &quot;What's happening?&quot; Since it is past Day 1, you must already know what you're doing and have a partner. No Pacting after day one. 3. Use your imagination. Don't restrict yourself from getting involved in the story. However, if your idea is pretty drastic, please ask first. &quot;The World Ends with You&quot; is property of Square-Enix. All sprites credited to respective owners. Players: 4/20 Reapers: 4/20 Current Day: Week 3- Day 0 Current GM: ??? Reaper Channel: http://livestream.com/thereaperschannel</textarea></td>
