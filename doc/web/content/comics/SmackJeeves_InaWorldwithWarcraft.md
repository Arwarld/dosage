<th>Description</th><td>The world has been torn apart and only recently started coming back together again. As humans, we of course find an issue that divides the remaining population into two opposing sides. After having destroyed all knowledge of war, the only thing we can fight with is found to be a video game, the World of Warcraft. With more advanced technology, we are able to turn this video game into a virtual reality, battling quite realistically with each other. One woman finally is able to become a part of this new war, but how will others accept her?</td>
