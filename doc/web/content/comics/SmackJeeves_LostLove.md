<th>Description</th><td>Matt has always been neglected by his parents, but he dosn't care anymore - he has found the one he love. The only problem is that that 'love' is his best friend, Joshua - another guy. To make it even worse, Joshua already has a boyfriend, so Matt dosn't dare to confess his feelings. But the boyfriend, Daniel, acts like a total jerk towards Matt, who can't help but despise the guy - for more than one reason. Nonetheless he decides to hide his feelings, and support Joshua and Daniel as a couple, the best he can. Though one fatefull day, Daniel comes with a strange request, that Matt can't refuse; &quot;Come to my house, or I'll break it off with your friend.&quot; What will Matt do from then on? Can he keep a secret from Joshua, a secret that's slowly breaking him apart? Why does Daniel do as he does and why the hell is the strangest thing starting to turn Matt's life upside-down?! WARNING!! Contains Yaoi/BL/shounen ai and soooo on - you know the rest ;)</td>
