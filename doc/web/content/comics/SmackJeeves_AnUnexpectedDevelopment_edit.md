<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">In a world where Megaman and Roll have swapped genders and become a pair of human teenagers, there is a need for new heroes to rise in order to protect the city from both new and old threats. Instead they get Sam and Alex. Two mischievous high-school students find themselves in a predicament which is quite the opposite of Rock and Roll's, but just as awkward. Will they be able to get used to their new-found &quot;changes?&quot; ______________________________________ Well, here it is. This is a little project I've been working on for a bit. I guess you could call this my tribute to the old enjoyable Mega Man 7 style comics that popped up here and there during the golden age of spriting. Remember to read &quot;Slight Miscalculation&quot; by Mitchell00 in order to understand what's going on in this comic. http://www.smackjeeves.com/comicprofile.php?id=67755</textarea></td>
