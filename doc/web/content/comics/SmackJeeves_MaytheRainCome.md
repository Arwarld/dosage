-----------------------------------------

<table class="comicinfo">

<th>Description</th><td>William Weasel returns home after seven years of war only to find his hometown deep in a drought, and his life eerily empty and devoid of meaning. ------------ This comic updates every day in full color, so try not to fall too far behind! May the Rain Come is rated PG-13 (for depictions of PTSD and scary moments). Inspirations: Black-and-white movies, cartoon animals, stories passed down through the family about the horrors of war.</td>
