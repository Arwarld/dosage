<th>Description</th><td>William Weasel returns home after seven years of war only to find his hometown deep in a drought, and his life eerily empty and devoid of meaning. ------------ This comic became finished on March 31st, 2013 - about a year and a half after I began it. May the Rain Come is rated PG-13 (for depictions of PTSD and scary moments). Inspirations: Black-and-white movies, cartoon animals, stories passed down through the family about the horrors of war.</td>
