To journey into the south Alyn will need the help of his childhood friend, Nirin. Only, Nirin is a lot more enchanting than he remembered and every step closer to the mythical Garden of Hearts is a step further from his goals. story specs: light-hearted fantasy romance BOY X GIRL. tech: hand-drawn, b &amp; w, toned.</textarea></td>
