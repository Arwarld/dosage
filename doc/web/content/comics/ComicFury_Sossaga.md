<th>Description</th><td>Ages long forgotten, the celestial Goddess Alitheea felt betrayed by the creatures she had birthed and released devastating curses upon the worlds. Thus all trembled in fear... Hundreds of years since, and the worlds had yet seen a conclusion to the Goddess' calamities. Some sought to free themselves from the deity, some sought to dominate those weaker than them, and others simply wished to be left alone. The Seraph, the disinclined and untrained heroine, is given the daunting task of figuring out what had happened in the past that had set the stage for the upcoming era. Unable to comprehend her new life, she is constantly diminishing into anguish and hardship. With the protection of the Scions, the Seraph must fight to save the worlds, the persons she loves, and herself. So much for one teenage girl to do...</td>
