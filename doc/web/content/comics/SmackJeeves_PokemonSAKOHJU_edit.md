<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">Different adventures kick off with different characters in different parts of the Pokemon world! There's darkness in the Pokearth, and it's not just Team Plasma. A group by the name of Team Midnight is on the rise. However, their biggest obstacle appears when the protoganists come together to form SAKOHJU, an organization dedicated to ridding the Pokemon world of evil. As the fight rages, it's unclear how many will make it out alive, as it all comes down to SAKOHJU vs. Team Midnight... ____________________ I started this comic a couple years ago so some parts of it (beginning especially) aren't all that good. It's become more of a sketch comic and it's a learning experience for me, I improve and as my first project I'm seeing this thing to the end no matter what. I also have lots of characters based off real people. I will say that now. Also breaks the fourth wall. A LOT. Pokemon (c) Nintendo</textarea></td>
