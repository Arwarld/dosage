<th>Description</th><td>350 years have passed since the first and only mission beyond Human Occupied Space was launched. In search of the alien intelligence that sent such wondrous knowledge back to Earth, the Odyssey mission was lost. Now, denied their own home world by the rebellion of their own children creations, the Synthetics, humanity has become a race of despots and wanderers that meander through the stars, eking out an existence. Updated Tuesdays and Saturdays.</td>
