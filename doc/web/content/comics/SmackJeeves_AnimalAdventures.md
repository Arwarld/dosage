<th>Description</th><td>In a world similar to Pokemon minus the humans, intelligent creatures called Animals must use their amazing powers to save the galaxy. Many of the characters and storyline resemble things from various media. Contains action, violence, gore, romance, clean humor, adventure, possibly a few swear words, and extreme cuteness. Is read from left to right. This comic contains a lot of characters. Note: This comic does not update any schedule. I update when a new page is done.</td>
