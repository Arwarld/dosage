<th>Description</th><td>&quot;Lady Love received a magical book of the dark powers to her hands, and summoned a great, divine spirit. The spirit promises that Lady can make one wish, if she catches all the eight special albino souls and brings them to the spirit. Greedy Lady accepts the mission, and so the bloody collecting of albino humans begin... White is a tough and intense young man from the streets. He has been running away from Lady ever since when Love killed his gang and beloved. White is thirsty for revenge, but can do nothing but run away from Love and her henchmen... However, White finally meets Black, a friendly musician, who takes White with him and wants to help him in any way he possibly can. Both of them become good friends, but living in the same apartment makes both of them feel something stronger than just friendship...&quot; WARNING: This comic contains gay relationships, sex, blood, swearing, crying and angsting, confusing scenes, drama and possible grammar mistakes. NOTICE! I started the comic in 2008, so the first four chapters are pretty awful to read... but please bear it, 'cause I'm saving all the re-drawn pages for the possible-author's edition.</td>
