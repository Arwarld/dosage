Now, considered a traitor, he is imprisoned, but is soon broken out by a star warrior named Burning Leo.

Based on the anime! Updating: I make chapter long buffer zones, then update the pages daily. If it hasn't updated today, then I'm working on the next chapter. Sprites and backrounds ripped by: Drshnaps, Kung Fu Man, Zephyr_light, Gooniez, A.J. Nitro, HyperGumba, Ultragm2003, TJoe, Jackster, and KUTTER11 This is a fan comic.
