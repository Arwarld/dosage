<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">This a webcomic about a bunch of hopefully amusing people known as the eight state capital cities of Australia. Southern Cross is a moe anthropomorphization comic - in the vein of Hetalia, Afganisu-tan and the OS-tans to name a few - featuring Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart, Darwin, Adelaide and Perth. It's about their relationships, their rivalries, their teamwork, their personal tragedies, and the fact that they're all, at heart...a little dysfunctional. Primarily a comedy (or at least trying to be), you don't have to know anything about Australia for this. Hell, you don't even have to care about Australia either. And maybe you'll learn a thing or two...but don't worry. It's not that kind of educational. Updates when I can!</textarea></td>
