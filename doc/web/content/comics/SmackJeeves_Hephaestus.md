<th>Description</th><td>(a retelling of Greek mythology, with more than likely deviation from the original myths) While other gods on Mt. Olympus are known to be beautiful and laid back, Hephaestus is more humble in appearance and works his hands to the bone. However, that is not to say that the god of crafting and fire doesn't have any interesting tales about himself... &lt;&lt;Current Chapter&gt;&gt; 6) Origins: Part 3: Our tale of tragedy comes full circle as we learn of the final fate of young Hephaestus, leading to a fateful encounter between him years later with a certain Queen of the Nereids... &lt;&lt;Previous Chapters&gt;&gt; 1)Road to Athens: 2)Origins: Part 1 3)Passive Affection 4) Origins Part 2 5) Hermes' First Flight Hermes, the last of the Olympian twelve to join, starts his tale as a meek child with weak ankles, unable to live up to the &quot;God of Messengers&quot; name we know him for. It would take the guidance of a certain smith god to change all that soon enough...</td>
