<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Gary Oak is fed up with his wimpy friend Doug constantly clinging to him. With the help of his grandpa, professor Oak, he sends the self-esteemless boy into the dangerous world where giant rock-bodied snakes and bugs with poisonous venom will be the least of his problems. Hilarity ensues when Doug gathers a team of Pokémon completely unfitting for a coward like him. Then again, it's never just fun and games and this is the one thing Doug might actually know better than anybody else... --- Adaptation of a finished Pokémon Fire Red Nuzlocke run. Consists mostly but not exclusively of four-panel (yonkoma) comedic strips. Gets better... (=‿=)</textarea></td>
