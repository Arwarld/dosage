<table class="comicinfo">
<tr>
<th>Description</th><td>This webcomic has no amount of roleplaying (as of now or in the near future), and does NOT occur in a roleplaying-game universe with roleplaying-game rules. This webccomic DOES contain the story of a bunch of people living together or whatever, and there's supposed to be guns and explosions too. Centered around a main cast of characters, everyone with their perks and peculiarities, who just want to live a &quot;normal&quot; life, even when the destiny (script) pits them into battles where they might fight for more than their lives. And this webcomic also contains a (maybe not so) lenghty description describing in detail things that may or may not be true, depending on how do you interpret &quot;normal&quot;.</td>
