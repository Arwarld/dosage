The full name is really long: Kagome Chronicles-Whereabouts of Time. I forgot to write the date I actually started this, but I believe that it was in June 09, 2009. This is actually the first comic that I post to the public. I've done others but they're old works. So this is more practice for the future. This is a story more based on Kagome and her adventures three years after defeating Naraku. I don't write much of the story itself here cause once you see the first page, you'll see the description. Enjoy!</textarea></td>
