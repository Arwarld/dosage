<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">I did this comic in coorperation with a friend of mine. Drawings, idea, characters and translation [The originalversion is in German] are all my fault. Wanda strongly believes she is a princess and wants to prove it, since most people just do not want to pay tribute to her. Together with Avis, a wood imp who accompanies her out of pity, Wanda embarks on a journey to the Garucian Mountains to see the mighty wizard Hon-ar, whom she expects to trace her [as she believes] lost, royal parents. Unfortunately it turns out that the world has other plans for the young woman.</textarea></td>
