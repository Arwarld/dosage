<th>Description</th><td>Ikita is a young and impressionable noble, who has been bound to a young lady by arranged marraige. Felix is his hired bodyguard; a quick witted and reliable one at that - but who has more to his past than he would like to reveal. As Felix follows Ikita as his bodyguard, they start to have mixed feelings about their positions, and where the future may lead... Based in an 19th centrury-esque alternate history, this tale consists of friendship, compassion, love and regret.</td>
