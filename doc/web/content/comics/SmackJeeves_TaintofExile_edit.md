<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">There used to exist an empire which struggled against human invasion. One exiled sorcerer found himself in the middle of it all. During the time of Vikings there existed an empire by the border of today's Finland and Sweden. This empire, Prohenta, was inhabited by humans and a magical race called q'etyana. While the empire gets ready for a war against Vikings an exiled sorcerer gets himself involved with it all. This sorcerer was long ago exiled, but still he never left the kingdom. His past is a mystery as well the reason of his exile. There are many rumors of him and of a deceaced soldier and this soldier's missing lover, but no one seems to remember the truth. And now the sorcerer has returned to be an important player in the upcoming war.</textarea></td>
