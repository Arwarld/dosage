<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Scarlet spent all her life in a dismal, dark prison that just so happens to be located in a dismal, dark realm bereft of all flora and fauna. One night she ignores the frog's rule to never look out the window when darkness approaches. What she sees next will change her life and everything she once knew. It's a comic that delves deep into other character's lives and reflects on their back stories. Even though the main story seems to branch off to smaller stories, there is a basic plot, which the reader has to decide on. updated on weekends, but best to check it on Monday. It's finished! COMPLETELY FINISHED! Don't keep on checking for updates. Yes the first 100 pages looked like crap but mind you I started this when I was 14!</textarea></td>
