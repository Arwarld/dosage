<th>Description</th><td>Panzer Dragon and Enigma Zwei is the re-telling of the original story on SmackJeeves about protagonists Panzer Dragon, Enigma, and Niavana Avalon as they become involved in protecting their home from the move of a mysterious organization, spiraling into a battle that will decide the fate of so many worlds and reveal to this trio their destiny. Click on &quot;PDE: Complete Edition&quot; to check out the original story, but you do NOT have to read the Complete Edition to understand what's going on in PDE Zwei. Nevertheless, it's still an awesome read and you should check it out if you want an idea of my past works. Comics available every Monday, Thursday, and Saturday!!!</td>
