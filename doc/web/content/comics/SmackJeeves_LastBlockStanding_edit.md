<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">A post-apocalyptic story (yeah, we've never seen that before in a comic!) with just one premise: what would you do if you were the last people left on an utterly devastated world? Even more weirdly, what would you do if you were not only the last living things left alive, but you were all stuck in the same 40 storey (&quot;story&quot; US people) block of flats (apartments, US etc...)? Answer? defecate yourselves? commit suicide or somehow find someway to survive? These are the stories, drawn and written using only the Sketchbook App on an iPad with my clubby fingers. It's guerilla comic book creation and I hope you enjoy it despite its erratic fonts and pretty awful draftsmanship... Enjoy...</textarea></td>
