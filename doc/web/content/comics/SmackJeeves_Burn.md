<th>Description</th><td>Spunky young college student Darryn Gainnes has just turned 20, and decided to tone his wild ways down a bit. All he needs in life are his two best friends, their band, his books, and his music. He thinks nothing of it when he literally bumps into a pretty (and gloomy) High-School-boy at the park. But soon, Darryn finds himself swept up in a world he had never even known existed, a world of intrigues and violence and magic! And of course what is sweeping both boys off their feet is their budding romance... and so many incredible obstacles thrown in their way. Where will it all lead? Who is on their side... and who will be left standing? .:. 3rd place in the &quot;Drama&quot; category of the 2013 Smackie Awards! ^_^ WARNINGS: Occasional violence, &quot;bad&quot; language. BL: This is a Boys' Love/Yaoi comic! If you don't like those, don't read this one! DIRECTION: This comic reads right to left, for no other reason than that I like it that way. ALSO: I never have as much time as I would like, so for the most part this comic is pencil sketches and a bit of Photoshop. But I hope you enjoy it. ART: Improves as you go along! I promise. I started this thing a long time ago. ^^;</td>
