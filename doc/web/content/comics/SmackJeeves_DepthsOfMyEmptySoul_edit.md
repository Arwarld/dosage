<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Zadel, demon prince of Hell 7, struggles to prove himself to his mother and all who he's destined to rule over. The source of his struggles? His arch rival, yet best friend, Angel Abel. The truth is, Zadel rather spend his time enjoying Abel's company than act like the future ruler of Hell 7 and meanwhile other demons have their eyes on the throne. Zadel is being pressured to change his behavior and become a cold and respectable demon prince worthy of inheriting the throne, something that promises to put his friendship with Abel to the test. Will he finally make his final decision and chose his role as demon prince over his friendship with Abel? One night when Zadel's feeling bored and yearning for the company of Abel, he decides to pick on a down on his luck human. He tries and succeeds in persuading the human, Jacob, into making a bet with him wagering his own soul. Soon he realizes that picking on Jacob was not such a good idea. Bickering, jealousy and some romance ensues as Zadel and Abel both battle to doom or save Jacob's soul. But another more threatening battle approaches as well. BL, GL, HL Art improves over time.</textarea></td>
