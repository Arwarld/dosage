<th>Description</th><td>The long, convoluted story of Yuri, a recovering drug addict marooned on an alien planet, and the host of characters he encounters as he tries to navigate the difficulties he faces. He may or may not be the key player in a looming crisis that threatens to change the ENTIRE UNIVERSE(!) Among the people who help or hinder him in his journey are: MIRIYAM YUSEF, a rock and roll messiah CAMRUN SHAFT, an old man who apparently knows more than he's letting on BISHOP TIADORA, the pope of Iona V SISTER LENA, a nun formerly of the Geul Order JAELL, a choirgirl who is infatuated with Yuri, GRAVES, who may or may not be The Devil, and MALEAH, an &quot;extreme extraction specialist&quot; or assassin from Terra who has a contract to fulfill. Underneath it all, DESTINATION: UNKNOWN explores the theme of Destiny vs. Free Will with rayguns and spaceships (eventually) and rock and roll (soon) Please read on, and I hope you enjoy it!</td>
