<th>Description</th><td>new page posted every Saturday. reads R-to-L. ----------------- S Y N O P S I S Grief hates her job. She thought it would be romantic to be the human emotion for sadness -- instead it's nothing but heartbreaking. so she quits. and while she thinks she is giving her human, Ellison, a great gift by quitting, it is really just the opposite... ---------------- Farewell Feeling explores what would happen if our emotions....had emotions. the six basic human emotions of Grief, Joy, Anger, Surprise, Fear and Love are all personified, each with their own hopes, dreams and problems. -------------- note: I also take manga/comic sequential page &amp; illustration commissions. Farewell Feeling is not entirely representative of the quality of such work, since it is done just for fun/for myself. please email me if you are interested, and I can provide you with other samples. lilyhanamail@gmail.com -------------- if you're interested in my other work, please visit: http://rain-and-sunshine.deviantart.com thanks for reading!</td>
