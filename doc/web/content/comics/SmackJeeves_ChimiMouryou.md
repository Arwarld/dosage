Dosage comic SmackJeeves/ChimiMouryou
-----------------------------------------

<table class="comicinfo">
<tr>
<th>Description</th><td>Near the top of one of Japan's many mountains away from all the human villages, there is a forest inhabited by youkai who are constantly learning how to deal with each other. Basically, &quot;The Daily Lives of Crazy Youkai&quot; This comic is a bunch of random short stories and not one continuous one. Everything is acted out in pantomime AKA there are no written words. ~~~~~ Once I start a chapter, I (TRY VERY HARD TO) upload a page daily. Once a chapter's done, I take at least a week break. Due to fluctuating levels of work piled up on me, that break may be longer than week! Chimi mouryou can be roughly translated as &quot;evil monsters in the mountains and rivers&quot;. The legend of it keeps the forest safe from humans. I am still researching more about the Edo period and youkai, so I apologize for the awful inaccuracies everywhere. Unfortunately, it's hard to just go back and change everything when I find a little detail off. I try my best!</td>
