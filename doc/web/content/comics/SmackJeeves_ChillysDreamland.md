<th>Description</th><td>After failing to assasinate his target, Kirby, Chilly is beamed back up to N.M.E. just before disolving. Now, considered a traitor, he is imprisoned, but is soon broken out by a star warrior named Burning Leo. After gathering a team of both star warriors and monsters, Chilly, Birdon, Poppy, and all their allies continue their quest to build a resistance to N.M.E., all while uncovering a plan that may threaten the entire galaxy. Based on the anime! Updating: I make chapter long buffer zones, then update the pages daily. If it hasn't updated today, then I'm working on the next chapter. Sprites and backrounds ripped by: Drshnaps, Kung Fu Man, Zephyr_light, Gooniez, A.J. Nitro, HyperGumba, Ultragm2003, TJoe, Jackster, and KUTTER11 This is a fan comic. Kirby and all related characters belong to Nintendo and Hall Laboratory. I do not own these characters, nor do I make any profit of this comic. No copyright infringement intended. If you wanna support the original franchise without making me profit, go buy a copy of &quot;Kirby's Return to Dreamland.&quot; Seriously, it's like, the best action game you'll ever play.</td>
