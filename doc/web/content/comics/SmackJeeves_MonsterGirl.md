<th>Description</th><td>An off and on comic first conceived during my elementary school years.

WARNING: This comic is EXTREMELY experimental, so try to ignore the ever changing artwork. Also it's pretty dramatized... Summary: A group of high school students have the ability to transform into animals, but what's the story behind their mysterious powers? Find out on their dangerous search for the answer.</td>
