<th>Description</th><td>An off and on comic first conceived during my elementary school years. The whole thing was pretty much a giant experiment for practice, though it's over now.Hope you like it if you're brave enough to read it! WARNING: This comic is EXTREMELY experimental, so try to ignore the ever changing artwork. Also it's pretty dramatized... Summary: A group of high school students have the ability to transform into animals, but what's the story behind their mysterious powers? Find out on their dangerous search for the answer.</td>
