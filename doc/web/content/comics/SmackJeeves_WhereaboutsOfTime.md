<th>Description</th><td>Inuyasha (c) Rumiko Takahashi Kagome Chronicles-Whereabouts of Time(c) matsujun4me aka Catherine Fermin Sukujou &amp; Renkayasha(c) matsujun4me So this is my story: Whereabouts of Time or WOT for short. The full name is really long: Kagome Chronicles-Whereabouts of Time. I forgot to write the date I actually started this, but I believe that it was in June 09, 2009. This is actually the first comic that I post to the public. I've done others but they're old works. So this is more practice for the future. This is a story more based on Kagome and her adventures three years after defeating Naraku. I don't write much of the story itself here cause once you see the first page, you'll see the description. The cover pgs didn't come out so good. But the story will be better, I promise. There will things that are not expected.</td>
