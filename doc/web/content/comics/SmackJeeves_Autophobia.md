<th>Description</th><td>Louis Beau is a perfectionist and anxiety-ridden eleventh-grader attending Roseborough High. He lives with his strict and somewhat neglectful father, and constantly tries to best himself to make his father proud. His life, however, runs off course when he befriends Daniel, his ostrasized classmate, and the two soon find themselves in a secret love affair. Louis struggles with his sexuality, and his growing fondness of Daniel, all the while trying to gain the approval of his father, his peers, and ultimately, his self. [updates every Sunday] Autophobia is also available on InkBlazers with coloured pages! Updates every Tuesday &amp; Thursday. If you're a fan of the comic, I definitely invite you to read it over there, as there are significant scene/dialogue that you won't want to miss! http://autophobia.inkblazers.com --- Warning: gay ppl, straight ppl, awkward ppl, a plethora of dialogue, profanity, sexual themes/content, and an absurd amount of fluff. *Mature content is on for some of the future themes explored, but there's nothing explicit. **It's labelled a &quot;BL&quot;, but the story is not a typical &quot;shounen ai&quot; :U</td>
