<th>Description</th><td>The story of a dude named Louis who tries to accept himself for who he is and to learn to not let others step all over him. It follows him through the course of his life and the relationships he builds with others, particularly with his classmate Daniel. [Updates every Sunday] --- Warning: gay ppl, straight ppl, awkward ppl, a plethora of dialogue, profanity, sexual themes/content, and an absurd amount of fluff. /Mature content is on for some of the future themes explored, but there's nothing explicit./</td>
