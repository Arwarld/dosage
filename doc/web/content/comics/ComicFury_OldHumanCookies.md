<th>Description</th><td>These are the older comics in my Human Cookies series. I've been asked by a few people to upload them, so here they are (well once they're all up anyway) I know some of them look bad, the focuses are terrible, the lighting is...well...yuck, but this is where I started, so they bring back some smiley memories for me, so enjoy the tackiness!</td>
