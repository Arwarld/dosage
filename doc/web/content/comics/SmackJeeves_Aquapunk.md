<th>Description</th><td>A high-tech, fantasy adventure about ghosts, robots, and aliens. - YES, this comic is being updated here on Smackjeeves again as a mirror to the full Aquapunk site, http://aquapunk.co. &quot;What's up with the pages?&quot; Well, in preparation for putting out books (Sand and Sieve will be wrapping up in just a few weeks), I've decided to go and redo/touch-up all the old pages. A couple scenes have been extended/reworked also, so expect some bumps when reading for now. For a detailed view of my progress, check out http://aquapunk.co/redo &quot;How often are you updating now?&quot; At AP.co, 5 pages monthly. But here, I'll be spreading out those updates to once a week or so. So, odds are (4/5, to be precise) that there is more for you to read than what you see here!</td>
