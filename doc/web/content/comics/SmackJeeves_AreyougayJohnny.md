<th>Description</th><td>This is not a BL webcomic, but there might be boys looking for boys. This is not a love webcomic, but there might be people in love. This is not a satirical webcomic, but there might be some satirical situations. This is not a hentai webcomic, but there might... no, there is sex in it. This not a comedy webcomic, but there might be some laughs. This webcomic is my humble homage to the 21st. Century young people. Growing in a world that no longer requires anything from them, grandsons of hippies, sons of punks, living in an ultra modern world where a nickname values more than a real name. Where most people fills their mouth to speech about freedom, but then they are the firsts to prejudice. In this post-apocalyptic world, Johnny finds himself with a big dilemma; he doesn't know who he is. He doesn't have amnesia, he just got the luck to live in a world that moves fast and left him alone with no clues whatsoever of why he was there in the first place. Follow Johnny and Leslie's misadventures to find the answers to the most basic questions about their own identity.</td>
