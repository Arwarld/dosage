<th>Description</th><td>The Dragon and the Lemur is a web manga drawn by Vilani Vil√° and scripted by the same and CherryVincent. In few words, a RP between the artist and CherryVincent, which Vilani decided to transform into a Manga. D.a.L (for short) tells us the story of two characters, Hakakku (a humanoid, hybrid between Cat and a Lemur) and Chain (a humanoid, dragon). They both met, probably not under the best circumstances and ended up falling in love. The script is currently finished. This comic contains explicit content and homosexual relationships. Bestiality/shota/incest may be often mentioned. May have blood and gore. NC-17 YAOI/HENTAI/YURI Update schedule: MONDAY Started: Sept 2005 Status: On going</td>
