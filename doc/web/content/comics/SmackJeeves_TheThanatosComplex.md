<th>Description</th><td>What if you only had a month to live and could do whatever you wanted with no consequences? That is the question posed by Allen Pearson, the protagonist of my graphic novel, The Thanatos Complex. This documentary-style, realist story in the visual style of Alex Maleev and the film A Scanner Darkly, is comprised of images from the final months before Allen's planned suicide. Allen, a high-powered California mortgage broker, is thirty-one years old and seems to have it but he knows that his life is actually a monotonously boring and, ultimately, meaningless. Determined to give his life meaning, if only for a little while, Allen embarks on a freewheeling journey of self-destructive hedonism. Will Allen manage to turn his life around before he closes the book forever? Told through the lens of a documentary crew and increasingly delusional vision, The Thanatos Complex ponders the darkest recesses of the human soul and examines that most basic of questions: Why are we here?</td>
