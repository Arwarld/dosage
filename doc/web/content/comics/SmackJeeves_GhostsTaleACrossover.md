<th>Description</th><td>Willow is taken away from her home and made to look for a special medallion. Supposedly, this amulet has the power to stop a war occurring in a very distant, possibly even other-wordly, land. It sounds simple at first, but it is soon realized that the problem may not lie solely in finding, but retrieving... *This is a story set in a pokemon region, but it does not completely focus on pokemon itself. *Some canons will be included, though they will be much older/more mature than in the anime. *I do not own Pokemon or Pokemon characters. Pokemon is (c) GAME FREAK &amp; co.</td>
