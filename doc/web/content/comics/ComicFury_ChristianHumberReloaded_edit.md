<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">Once upon a time, an unpopular kid in a boarding school had his anime taken away and he turned to writing. He created what is simultaneously the worst and the best story ever created. This is that story's comic-book interpretation. You have been warned. Christian Humber Reloaded rips off/steals from every video game and anime ever made. Yes, even that one. It also has Bionicles. And Hitler. And it's supposed to be serious.</textarea></td>
