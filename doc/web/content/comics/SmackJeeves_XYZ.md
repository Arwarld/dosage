<th>Description</th><td>[COMPLETE] ~~~READS LEFT-TO-RIGHT~~~ Two twin sisters, Tomi and Tori, grew up with the average twin sister life- sharing everything: their faces, their clothes, their grades... And then they hit puberty. Tomi went through the expected changes- filling out in places, and going all out &quot;girly&quot;. As for Tori...not so much. What her sister got in chest she got in height, and that was basically it. This unexplainable change makes everyone think Tori is a guy, and more particularly, Tomi's brother (which helps Tomi out alot). However, crossing the line can be painful and dangerous, and above all, lonely. ZOMG, It's actually a romance/shoujo *_* UPDATES Tues, Thurs Saturday and/or Sunday</td>
