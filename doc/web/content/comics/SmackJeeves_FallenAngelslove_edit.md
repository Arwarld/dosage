<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">A cute BL story No smex for awhile sorry! :D Hiro and Taisuke have known each other for many years, they have been friends for as long as they can remember. However, Hiro is a demon who is fated to be locked up for all his life and Taisuke is an angel who's a bit of a play boy. What will happen when Hiro begins to long for freedom so much he would do anything to obtain it? When Taisuke realizes that his feelings for Hiro are a bit more than friendship will he run away or embrace those feelings? When heaven and hell clash how could such a love be accepted? Sounds cliche but I promise it will be a enjoyable read XD</textarea></td>
