<th>Description</th><td>Lucas had expected a summer full of video games and hanging out with friends before his parents &quot;volunteered&quot; him to put his college degree to use and help his aunt Lola and cousin Noelle renovate their house. Though he is strongly against wasting his summer on backbreaking labor for room and board in a sleepy little town with no cable or internet, he finds it even worse that he has to renovate alongside Noelle's best friend Ashley, who is also helping in his spare time out of the goodness of his heart. Lucas is convinced Ashley has an ulterior motive and is determined to ambush him at every angle. This is a BL comic, meaning it will contain scenes with romance between two boys. But I bet you already knew that, amirite? ;) Updates every Friday (at the very least)</td>
