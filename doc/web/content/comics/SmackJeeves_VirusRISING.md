Armed with enhanced stamina, uncontrollable rage, and insanity, an infected canine turns against its captors and flees to the streets. Left to his own agenda, Katzbalger spreads the infection and builds up a pack bent upon slaughtering humans and 'impure' dogs alike for the sake of &quot;evolution.&quot; A small group of street dogs have banded together in a struggle for survival, and those few with a natural immunity to the virus stand as the only defense against devastation. read all current issues on virusrising.com UPDATES i forget to post the pages here sometimes but i draw a new page usually on the weekends!
