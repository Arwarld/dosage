<th>Description</th><td>Oigo Oretachi is not a super hero, but he has a job as one. its All because of the several super powers he has. Yes, he has lots of powers. His powers are feed by an internal energy. once he runs out of energy, he is completely normal. Well, at least from the super-human point of view. To recharge his powers, he must suck on some woman's big natural breasts. It is the only way to do it! Oigo TM Diego J. All rights reserved.</td>
