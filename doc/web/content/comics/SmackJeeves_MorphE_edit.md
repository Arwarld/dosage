<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Updates Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 7am EST. After their rescue from a madwoman's hellish subterranean caverns, five humans have their eyes opened to the dark truth lurking under normal society. A &quot;benefactor&quot; takes them in, but he's a cold-blooded killer with a deadly fixation on the new mages. In a world of magic, mages, and far creeper creatures, can he be trusted? Can anyone? Warning: morphE is a kinetic novel slightly animated in flash. It involves themes of brutal violence, sexuality (gay, straight, and other), and much cruelty. If dark or adult content offends you, this may not be your cup of tea.</textarea></td>
