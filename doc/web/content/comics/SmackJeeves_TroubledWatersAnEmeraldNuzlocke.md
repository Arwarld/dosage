<th>Description</th><td>Thrown into the midst of a terrible disaster in the Pokémon world, KK must get to the bottom of the mystery - before it's too late. Lives are at stake, the world of Pokémon is falling into ruin, and the team has to try and find out where the Nuzlocke disease came from. Only danger lies down that road, but that's where destiny leads. Of course, because Professor Birch asked him to do it, he's got to take a Pokédex with him too. Go figure. _______________ Updates every Monday at 00:00 GMT.</td>
