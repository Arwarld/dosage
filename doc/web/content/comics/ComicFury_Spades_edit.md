<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">DISCONTINUED Spades is created by my proudly obnoxious teenage MonsterBrat with it's upkeep done by me. M.B. will referred to as 'it', by it's own request. We both play World of Warcraft as well as various offline games so alot of what is posted will reflect that and it's uncensored (shudder) creepiness. Eventually it will no longer be a teenager and I'll have to change this info thingy again. ~Rrayven</textarea></td>
