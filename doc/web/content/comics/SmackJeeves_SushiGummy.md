-----------------------------------------

<table class="comicinfo">
<tr>
<th>Description</th><td>A comic about George, a 'normal' gamer who just happens to have his video game consoles possessed. Why? Maybe you'll find out later. These possessed systems suck George into the game until he beats it. &quot;The first comic I've read in a long time that actually made me laugh hard enough to choke.&quot; -Recon Dye, Pokémon X &quot;I'm gonna get to the point. Sushi Gummy has got to be the funniest thing I've ever reviewed, or even read on Smack Jeeves.&quot; -Beastie, Comic Reviews &quot;If I could compare the humor of Sushi Gummy to anything that I know, it would be like a kitten. It looks cute, but it has claws, fangs, and is a merciless killer.&quot; -BlueLink, Second Opinion Reviews Express Current comics: Super Smash Bros Brawl Pokémon Animal Crossing Hitman Super Mario Galaxy E3 '08 Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Nintendogs</td>
