<th>Description</th><td>Fire Heart is &quot;collaboration&quot; comic which has been going on since November 2008. Its original idea was to be Sonic fancharacters adventure story but we have begun to change characters to more original form and these days it is more semi-fancharacteristic and we are trying to continue to change our comic even more original. (But we won't change older pages because this comic's idea is to continue all the time and tell the story and learn more about doing comics. So we are doing it for fun!) These days this project has about ten different artist working on it. (Notice that some older artists have left this project long time ago.) So please don't judge our work for its old (somehow horrible) pages.</td>
