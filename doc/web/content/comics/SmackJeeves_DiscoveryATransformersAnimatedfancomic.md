<th>Description</th><td>&quot;It's a story about four losers and their cat.&quot; &quot;Discovery&quot; is a Transformers Animated fancomic. It is an AU &quot;what if&quot; tale if Prowl took up Lockdown's offer in &quot;A Fistful of Energon&quot;. Yeah, yeah, it's been down, but I want to do one. The comic centers on bounty hunting team Crescendolls (named humorously by Wreck-Gar) composed of leader Lockdown, ninjabot Prowl, team pet Skippy the cat, crazy loon Wreck-Gar, and smart guy Perceptor as they get into misadventures and just discover their personal demons. A good knowledge of the canon TV show is required as I will be referencing it a lot. The genre is romance/drama/comedy.</td>
