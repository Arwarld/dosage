<th>Description</th><td>Meet Kid. A teen straight out of high school with his whole life a head of him. Until it ends in a tragic traffic accident. Meet Grimm Death. A Reaper with the power of life and all other sorts of power at his disposal. He's highly respected in the Reaper realm and is seen as a Godly figure. In truth he is an arrogant, narcissistic, selfish, annoying, loud ego filled man that asks for no permission before doing what he wills. He owns the Deadwood Hotel and his goal is to make the hotel grow to multimillion dollar company. Grimm Death brought Kid back to life and informs the boy that he will now be working as a maid in order to pay off the debt of gaining a new life from Death. There will be boylove, girllove and just love in general. But mostly boys crushing on other boys. I'm currently going back and redoing the first chapter. Please bear with me as I replace the older pages with shiny new ones.</td>
