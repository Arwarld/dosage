<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">*Main plot starts at chapter three* There is only one Pokemon capable of learning any move, and that’s Mew. Project HM 00 wants to change that. During the project’s test run, a program error occurs and Missingno, an incomplete Pokemon is created. Missingno has no real form and needs oran berries to stay alive. It has no intentions of staying incomplete, though, and it’ll stop at nothing to find what it’s missing. -Pages are now in color (starting with Ch 5, pg15) -Updates: As often as I can!(At least a page a week, hopefully)</textarea></td>
