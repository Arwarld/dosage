<th>Description</th><td>Evil Plan takes the superhero world and flips it, viewing things from the supervillain's perspective. The story follows Dr. Kinesis' journey on the road to world conquest. On the way, he'll have to deal with a troublesome AI, his unwilling friendship with crazy black-market dealers, and the possibility of romance with his second-in-command. And the superhero. Can't forget that guy. With all this going on, Evil Plan is a comic for people who want to see the bad guy win. If he doesn't blow himself up first.
