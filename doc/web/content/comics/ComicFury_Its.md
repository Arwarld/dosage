<th>Description</th><td>The year is 2180. Immortality is now a commonly-available genetic modification, but complete unkillability has yet to be achieved... Or so the universe thinks. A single batch of military-grade prototype GELFs (Genetically Engineered Life Forms) has exhibited this ability, but at the cost of being rendered mentally unfit for military life. Cooped up for a year, the GELFs manage to escape from the facility that made them. Being a terrible pilot, one GELF, codenamed &quot;Yellow&quot;, crash-lands its escape craft on the swamp planet of Bloogis V. After getting stuck in the swamp, Yellow is rescued by two employees from a refueling station orbiting Bloogis. With no ship, no money, and nowhere to turn, Yellow makes up a new name and a gender for itself, re-dyes its fur, and asks for a job on board the station. A couple weeks later, and Yellow, now known as Chaz, is already getting the hang of his job, mixing drinks, talking with customers, the works. What kinds of weird and wonderful customers will he meet while working at the Intergalactic Truckstop? (The comic doesn't have a lot of mature language, but there's a swear here and there so I figured I'd play it safe!)</td>
