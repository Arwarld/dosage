<th>Description</th><td>Life sucks. Life sucks worse when you’re doing it alone. Elias learns the hard way that falling down can be devastating without friends. And getting up after falling down is never easy. Unless, of course, you’re not alone anymore. --- Masquerade will update on Sunday every week. NOTE: You may read up to two completed chapters ahead at Twelve Gates Manga (http://twelvegatesmanga.com). I post complete chapters there as opposed to weekly pages here. There are a few up already if you prefer to get ahead and read in bulk!</td>
