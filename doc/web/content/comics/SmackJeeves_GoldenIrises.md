<table class="comicinfo">
<tr>
<th>Description</th><td>Gay. Updates Tuesdays and Fridays. Will be 33 chapters long. I plan on publishing it eventually. The books will be really cool and have a lot of extra info. Sort of... intense. I guess. This comic project is honestly my baby. Those other projects, I dropped. Yeah. This though, I've been working on and tweaking for 2+ years already. So I will finish it. It is the most important to me and also I draw the two main characters constantly so if that doesn't say anything about how much I care for it, nothing does.</td>
