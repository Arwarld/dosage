<th>Description</th><td>Aranya is an ambitious woman. At age 24 she's already the head--and founder--of the local mafia. When she stumbles into a one Takana Damashii Witzbold, she decides to take him on as a side project; to shape the young man into something useful. But Damashii's own goals, sparked to life by the chance presented to him by Aranya, may be much higher than to be just the asset of another. As Damashii draws to his side a wide collection of interesting (and invaluable) companions, he may become a match for even Aranya. Mafia, spiders, very tall men, very crazy men, very girly men, very dominant women, horses with fangs, glasses, a tad bit of fabulousness, circus tents. If any of these offend you, you probably shouldn't read this.</td>
