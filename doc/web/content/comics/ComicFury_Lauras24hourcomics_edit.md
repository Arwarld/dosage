<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Stuff that Laura's drawn for 24 Hour comic events. At such an event you usually try and draw 24 pages of comics in 24 hours. The two main events entered are &quot;The Comikaze Challenge&quot; in June of each year, and &quot;24 Hour Comic Day&quot; in October of each year. It changes, but recently I've always drawn via the computer for the former, and by hand for the latter. This also includes comics drawn as a substitute for an entry (such as &quot;Floods and Storms&quot;) and to complete the storyline of an unfinished entry (like &quot;Part Three&quot;). I usually try and draw one page a day for those.</textarea></td>
