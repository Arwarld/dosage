<th>Description</th><td>Be-Twin is an amateur comic which smells of powder, shootings, and the mafia. Its true premise however, centers around two destinies which have, with difficulty, found their place in this dangerous world. Two individuals who are different in every way… or perhaps… not very different at all. I upload pages every two weeks, on Sundays. I’m French, so please forgive any mistakes I may make. I really wanted to share this story with my non-French readers ;-; Thank you so much for reading… &gt;w&lt; Thank you so much for reading... &gt;w&lt;</td>
