<th>Description</th><td>Ah, Kalviva! A bright, bustling city. It's a crossroad for trade and all kinds of people have made their way there. Sometimes ... very strange people. Kalviva is also home to the biggest, most impressive, thief system. Prentice, following his exiled brother from the north, has made his way to Kalviva. He stumbles into one such thief cell (much to the embarrassment of his guildmates). Casting aside his strict warrior training doesn't come easily. His attempts at fitting in are nearly as bad as his attempts at thieving. However, the thieves live comfortably, certain of their protection, certain of their domain, and certain of each other. It is this stability Prentice seeks. But perhaps they are a little too comfortable. They will be hard pressed to handle what happens. Updates twice a week, Monday and Friday!
