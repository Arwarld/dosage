<th>Description</th><td>Our story begins in Kalviva, after Prentice and Orestes have made their way south from a distant land. They get stuck doing senseless mercenary work and - feeling unfulfilled - find themselves following other possibly questionable paths. Prentice becomes a thief (admittedly on accident, much to the embarrassment of his new guild mates) and Orestes is forced to follow up with an unsavory, uptight fighter's guild. Well, it's better than the alternative --- looking for lucky slippers never was all that exciting anyway. Updates twice a week, Monday and Friday! Fantasy/ Comedy/ Drama/ Action/ Adventure/ Romance</td>
