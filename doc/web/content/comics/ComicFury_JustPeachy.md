<th>Description</th><td>&quot;Just Peachy&quot; is a cheeky serial comic strip featuring a small college town's generation of college alums who aren't giving up and growing old without a fight. Kids: don't let your parents fool you, this is exactly how they behave when they think you're not looking. Parents: don't try to act all dignified and deny it. Liar, liar, pants on fire. In fact, you're probably worse than this.</td>
