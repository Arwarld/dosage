<th>Description</th><td>Ilona hates her new neighbor! Sure he might be a tall, athletic, motorcycle-riding hot model kind of a guy but he's snarky and rude. Just like the jocks in school that used to make fun of Ilona because she was a nerdy tomboy girl. And did he say something about Ilona's panties?! This means war! Ilona wants him gone, right now! Because he's a horrible person...but wait, he actually has a kind side? ...and how come he's always helping her out when she's in a pinch? this is...(you guessed it!) a BOYxGIRL romance sprinkled with a lot of humor and a few tearjerking moments. Hand-drawn, scanned and screentoned.</td>
