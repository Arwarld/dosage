<table class="comicinfo">
<tr>
<th>Description</th><td>A sci-fi fairytale. A boys nightmare. So, this is about an Evil Empire soldier with a few problems... not the least of which is a slight gender issue and a weird entanglement with an astronaut. Awkwardness ensues. D: I thought &quot;The Crying Game&quot; was a comedy, you've been warned. Ha! e_e Also I started this about 200 years ago and the art is pretty rough I'M SO SORRY! ;_; FORGIVE ME!</td>
