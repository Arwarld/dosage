A smackjeeves mirror to the comic on DrunkDuck, which you can read [url=http://www.drunkduck.com/Case_1048_Blind_and_Blue/]here[/url] Comic contains swearing very rarely,so if you don't like it...you'll be fine actually And if you're homophobic...message me with your reasons why as I am very curious on the topic.</td>
