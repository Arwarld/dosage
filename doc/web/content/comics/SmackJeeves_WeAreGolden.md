<th>Description</th><td>&quot;We are not what you think we are, we are golden&quot; (Mika, We are Golden 2009) A story of self-discovery, sexuality and relationships. When Olivia Barclay was forced to move from her high class private school to a scummy comprehensive it felt like the end of the world. But it was only the beginning... (God, anyone want some wine with that cheese? I'm really no good at taglines!) Warning: contains examples of British humour. If there's any slang you don't understand, just ask :) Also, yaoi, yuri, het and any other kind of relationships you can think of. Updated Wednesday and Sunday. Mostly.</td>
