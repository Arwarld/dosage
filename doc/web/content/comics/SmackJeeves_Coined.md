<th>Description</th><td>'Coined!' is a BL (and occassionally nsfw) super hero series that takes place in Samaritan City, a place where special powers are so common that even your neighbours cat can be a villain of a hero. With telephone booths popping up like daisies and the Evil Guild and the FBD spending more time battling lawsuits than each other, Eli Stone has a hard time adjusting to the ever changing city after his seven year prison break. Torn between the life and lover he left behind and becoming the trainer of a lovestruck wannabe hero, he finds that, like himself, the traditional roles of heroes and villains may have changed.</td>
