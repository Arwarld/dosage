<th>Description</th><td>This comic is a Firered Nuzlocke run. Lisa, a young girl from kanto starts her journey to become the Pok√©mon master. Updates Sundays! Also visit my tumblr account and ask Leaf questions! http://lisa-leaf.tumblr.com/ Laufente has helped me with the coloring until page 63, but I figured I should learn how to do backgrounds and attacks myself so I will do it alone from now on. Laufente has her own Nuzlocke as well so please look at Road to Glory as well :D</td>
