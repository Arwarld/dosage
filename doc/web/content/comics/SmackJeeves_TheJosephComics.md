<th>Description</th><td>What started out as &quot;Joseph and His Comics&quot; in 2003 became the first minimal comic strip series by amateur cartoonist Joseph Scarbrough. The comic centered around fifteen-year-old Joseph Armstrong - just you're typical, average, American teenager who just so happens to get himself in and out of random situations that give way to continuing storylines with serial cliffhangers much like the old &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; show (which adopted said format from old movies and westerns of the 50s). In 2004, Scarbrough &quot;revamped&quot; the comic strips, renamed it to simply &quot;Joseph Comics&quot; which carried on until Scarbrough announced his retiring from comic strips, thus making Joseph and his friends find their place in the Old Cartoon Stars Retirement Home permanently come 2008.</td>
