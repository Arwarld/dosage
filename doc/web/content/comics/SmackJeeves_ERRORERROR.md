<th>Description</th><td>A finnish teenage boy Tomi is a normal nerd. He plays videogames and gets average grades, but also is terribly bored with his life. But one day he accidentally gets inside of his computer and meets there a girl, who calls herself princess Jooda. And there is a profecy about Tomi, sword and Viruses. Warnings: If you are under 13 years old, I do not recommend this comic to you. Contains bad language, blood and somewhat sexual themes. ps. This started out as a test for new tablet, so the start looks like that too. Also, sorry about the style changes, I practice. Updates 2-4 pages a week.</td>
