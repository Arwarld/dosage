<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">An homage, tribute, parody, and nod to animated cartoons of day's past. From Disney or Don Bluth, 'Keeping Up with Thursday' is intended to be a quarterly monthly series with four issues a year (or bonus side comics, if time permits), about the adventures and lives of Patrick and Vinnie: two mice living in Victorian London. Vinnie, the American, is paired up with Patrick, a notorious thief, and their tales - tails! - herein, lie a grand sequence of events. Created in December 2010, and hopefully, longer. ((This comic will only be uploaded to a certain point here: Issue 5. To see the rest, please visit my DrunkDuck or deviantart... unless by some chance you'd like me to finish what I started here. :P))</textarea></td>
