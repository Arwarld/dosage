But ever so often Fabraz, our chaotic protagonist, finds himself in rather silly situations. Be prepared to be wowed and get ready to follow Fabraz on his epic adventure. You can also buy the first chapter as a printed comic book, if you want to support us! :) http://www.indyplanet.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=4243</td>
