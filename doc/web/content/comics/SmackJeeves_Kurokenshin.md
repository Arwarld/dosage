<th>Description</th><td>Started in December 2005, so the first Volume's art is a bit rough. Volume 5 was finished in Spring 2011. After finding a book on the legendary ronin Kokushiryu, Kentaro finds himself on the adventure he's always dreamed of. He joins Rika, a mysterious red-haired demon, who is searching for Kokushiryu's sword - Kurokenshin. However, she isn't the only one pursuing Kokushiryu's legend for the book; a cruel demon from the past is desperate to attain the sword, and he will go through any means to do so. ~READS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT~ UPDATES DAILY!!</td>
