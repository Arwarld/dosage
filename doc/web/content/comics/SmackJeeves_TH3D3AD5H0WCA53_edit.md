<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">In this show case it is our goal to have every kind of comic shown manga, anime, sprite etc for critique. So here you can advertise and show your comic pages for critiquing the art, layout, special effects, and style of the comic. There will be 5 sections to this comic. The Art section. A place to review, critique, to get help, and show off art work. The Comic section. A place to review, critique, show off comic pages, and to get help. (not the whole comic just individual pages for review on layout and such) The Advertisement section. That one is self explanatory. The Special effects section. A place to get help, tips, and critiques on custom special effects. And The sprite section. A place to review, critique, show off and get help on sprite work. Anyone and everyone is welcome to join. And sadly there are a few rules (TALKING TO YOU TROLLS LOL) Inappropriate content in either comments or other posts will be deleted. Swearing is allowed as long is it isn't offensive, and remember. Critique and help, not troll. Anyways that is all so enjoy!</textarea></td>
