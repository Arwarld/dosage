<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">On the distant world of Lethe, there lived the Queen of Nephele. Said to be desired by all men for her ethereal beauty. A beauty so divine even the Gods envied her, one particular Goddess decided to bless her favorite warrior with the beautiful woman as his gift, stealing the great Queen from her kingdom. The Queen's abduction led to a century long war, spreading throughout many, many lands. The King of Nephele created a rule, that for each city his army conquered, the Strategos would be gifted with the most beautiful maiden from that city. As a twisted take on what had happen to his wife. But one city was at a loss, for its most beautiful maiden, was far from beautiful. It was in fact, hard to find a fair beauty in this city at all. And thus the city panicked, not being able to find a sacrifice could lead to the massacre of their people. So in an act of desperation they gave the Strategos their most beautiful person. Now it is up to this -man- to survive the war in which he as been thrust head first into~ Welcome to the world of Lethe. Where everything beautiful, is possessed. A BL comic loosely inspired by the epic poem &quot;The Iliad&quot; by Homer</textarea></td>
