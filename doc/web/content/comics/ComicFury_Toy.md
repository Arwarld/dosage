<th>Description</th><td>Tripping Over You is a love story that addresses the awkwardness that comes from having feelings for someone you shouldn't - especially in the odd mix of drama and humor that is secondary boarding school. This story contains LGBT interactions - if that's not your cup of tea, this comic may not be for you.</td>
