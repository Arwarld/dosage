<th>Description</th><td>General Summary: A 4-koma series about a unique family and their ridiculous adventures. Exaggerated Summary: One drunk young perverted male adult, one mother-like genius male teenager, and one non-emotional straight forward female kid make up a small family and try to live the normal life, but due to their pasts and connections, it's prety difficult to accomplish. 8D Summary from Mangabullet: Two best friends and a bizarre, indifferent little girl make up a family in a small room of a Japanese apartment. Due to their pasts, their misadventures are taken in different places, and together, they try to unintentionally defeat their enemies in a comedic way while continuing their daily lives.
