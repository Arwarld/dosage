<th>Description</th><td>One of my favorite mangas is Lynn Okamoto's famous Elfen Lied (Which likewise I should clarify that I absolutely HATE the anime version) This comic is based on a trilogy story I wrote for FF.Net which I can't say was the best but it was fun nonetheless. --- Differences can be considered an alternate Universe Sequel to the manga. The story revolves around the actions of the second Queen Diclonius. --- It's all I can say, I'm not an artist, I just draw for fun. Enjoy Because it's based off of a Seinen Manga, there's going to be some adult content including Blood and Gore Language Nudity Sorry for inconsistent art as well. Read: Left to Right. When I started it, I didn't do as a traditional manga nor did I feel like changing it up either. Be nice, but feel free to criticize. --- Re-doing Volume I, updates will probably be weekly.</td>
