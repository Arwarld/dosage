<th>Description</th><td>Rei, a 15 year old student, has to switch to a new school because of an accident he caused at his previous one. Rei knows there is something wrong with him because everytime he's angry, any living thing he touches gets mysteriously ill. On Rei's first day at his new school, his bad luck lands him a detention and he ends up injuring himself on some misplaced equipment. Harumi, a girl in Rei's class, attempts to help him but backs off after seeing his wound heal itself before her eyes. Rei, not wanting to have this discovery spread, and not wanting to move schools again, decides that his only option is to make a deal and keep a sharp eye on Harumi, even if stalking is necessary. But, even with Rei's efforts to keep his ability secret, somehow people find out about it... These people call themselves &quot;viruses&quot; that have the intention to harm Rei for being the &quot;one of immortal blood&quot;. Due to the constant attacks, Rei and the friends he meets along the way search to find answers about Rei's past and why these &quot;viruses&quot; are after him. *** FB: https://www.facebook.com/virus000manga READ RIGHT TO LEFT &gt;Shounen &gt;UPDATED WHENEVER POSSIBLE, SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME!&lt; OTL</td>
