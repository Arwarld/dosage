<th>Description</th><td>so takumis had a crush on his teacher mr. asakura (who he lovingly calls sensei) for a long time now, but there are these dumb games that the girls play to see who can get a specific teacher to fall in love with them first, then dump them afterwards. and asakura’s next in the game. not only that, but this kid satoru, whos always bullying takumi, is getting in on the game too and according to everyone hes in the lead. takumi knows what a little shit satoru is and doesn’t want sensei to get hurt, and basically gets tricked into playing the game too. now hes gotta get sensei to fall in love with him before its too late. plots based off scramble game (it made me so mad I thought I could do it better HA) reads from left to right bl/yaoi will have nasty stuff later on~~</td>
