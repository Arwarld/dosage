<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description">Yeah, so I ran out of characters for the title. Trust the banner. 12-year-old girl Wolfgang Rock manages to convince her mom to let her stay with her ex-uncle-in-law-in-law instead of having to move. Soon enough, however, the said uncle, Dieter Jung, starts to have an innocent crush on the girl... This was the first full-length comic I ever did. Don't mind the amateur art and the fact that its unrealistic story could only be written by a child (indeed it was) and the JPEG fuzziness and and and... *COMPLETED! *Reads left to right *Not suitable for impressionable young girls/adult men with developing complexes *Nothing inherently inappropriate, either *The original comic before He Who Has Partners, which apparently takes place in an alternate universe</textarea></td>
