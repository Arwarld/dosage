<th>Description</th><td><textarea name="description" cols="40" rows="3">Ah, Kalviva! A bright, bustling city. It's a crossroad for trade and all kinds of people have made their way there. Sometimes ... very strange people. Kalviva is also home to the biggest, most impressive thief system. Prentice, following his exiled brother from the north, stumbles into one such cell (much to the embarrassment of his guildmates) and begins his journey to becoming a thief. His attempts to cast aside his strict warrior training are often fails. But it's better than the alternative. Doing merc board requests wasn't always glamorous. Well ... if ever. Updates twice a week, Monday and Friday! Fantasy/ Comedy/ Drama/ Action/ Adventure/ Romance</textarea></td>
