Everything seems peaceful, if sad... on the surface. Unbeknown to June, the doctor is deeply entangled in a terrible conspiracy against his will. Not wanting to get her involved in the mess, he keeps a lot of things secret from her, but there may be another—less noble—reason behind his secrecy...</td>
