<th>Description</th><td>Boy love! That's right. Mika Lin, a famous rockstar, has run away. And where else would he hide out but in the apartment of an unfortunate youth, college student Alex Bentley?! Now Alex has to help Mika find inspiration again before he can return to the stage! Unfortunately for him, this includes being molested and tormented on a daily basis! Rockstars are quite the handful, after all.</td>
