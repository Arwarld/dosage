<th>Description</th><td>A certain trainer and her pokemon team go through an interesting transformation. Having been stripped of their usual power, how will they deal with the problems within and without? With a spoonful of humour, of course! This is a spin-off of &quot;For The Wild&quot; (http://archiveofourown.org/works/802980). Updates randomly (aiming for once a weekend). Quality increases unintentionally.</td>
