<th>Description</th><td>Izmiu is a young ithi prince whose mother has died in childbirth. He is raised in exile, in a white castle down by the sea side, by a two-headed scary teacher and by his grief struck introverted father, who has turned quite mad, due to the death of his wife. What becomes of the life of Izmiu, when he is suddenly summoned to return to the city of Tykauiid after his fathers death? Will the new found relatives take the clumsy book worm prince under their wings or drag him unprepared to the center of the conspirations of the ithi high court?</td>
