<th>Description</th><td>&quot;He's been single for as long as I've known him and now that we're Seniors in High School, everybody and there MOM wants in his pant!?&quot; Josh tries to confess his love to his childhood friend Demetrius, but it doesn't quite work out as he plans. Something or someone is always getting in his way! Will he be able to tell his best-friend how he feels? Or will he let himself be distracted from his goal? Silly comic that will try to update on Mondays (and maybe days in between!) WARNING! This is a BL (Boy's Love) comic with Het and GL (Girl's Love) as a side serving. Dirty (&amp; improper)language, bad art, pingas, boobs. No smexy stuff yet, but its coming soon!</td>
