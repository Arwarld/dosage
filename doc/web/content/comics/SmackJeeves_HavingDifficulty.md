<th>Description</th><td>Robby is starting high school. In his mind, he's having difficulty fitting in. He barely knows anyone. Will the next four years change his attitude? Oh, I should probably tell you that this story will turn out to be a BL... but nothing will really happen. it's just a lot of frustrating scenes of ALMOST things. Updates twice per day. Midnight and noon.</td>
