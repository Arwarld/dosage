One day, the evil forces attacked the villages of many of these tribes with one goal: Kill the chief of each tribe. In order to prevent the Dark Tribes from acquiring their power, Rioshaku and the other 4 chiefs sealed away their power in 5 rings. Each chief handed down the rings to their eldest child and told them to run away and protect the rings with their life. And before they die, they are to pass the rings down from generation to generation. Thus, the children and their families had escaped not to be threatened ever again. Until now. In the present day city of Valdosa, Mag Lewis is a normal high school student who for his 16th birthday, received a ruby red ring from his father as a symbol of manhood. His father told him that one day, when his eldest son is old enough, he would pass the ring on to the next generation. Unknown to either of them about the power that lies within the ring itself until one day, Mag meets a transfer student from Mexico. The student, named Mika, tells Mag of the legend behind the ring and that it holds a great power. Thinking that Mika is insane, he ignores her story. One day, while walking home from school, Mag is stopped by an stranger calling himself a guardian of the darkness. He sends minions after Mag in order to retrieve the ring on his finger. Narrowly escaping, Mag runs into Mika again, whom he now believes in her story. She reveals herself as a priestess directly related to the head Priest of Rioshaku himself. Mik tells Mag about the power of Rioshaku, the Red Phantom, that lies within the ring. When the dark minions find Mag with Mika, she shows him how to activate the ring's power. Thus, Mag transforms into the Red Phantom. Now that he knows his potential and the seriousness of the evil Dark Forces, it is up to Mag to find the remaining bearers of the other 4 rings and awaken the spirits of the other Elemental Tribes and fight off the Dark Forces once and for all.") # 189

Attempt to summarize the plot: You begin the adventure as Boogie, the Nerdcat Furry who isn't really all that furry. You then proceed with various shenanigans throughout your house.. until weird shit happens of course. Yeah okay, really shitty summary, but if you can survive the first 150 pages or so you will be rewarded with an okay/decent yet complicated and confusing story alongside decent animations. This comic is suddenly semi interactive again. To put this comic bluntly, something to read when you run out of updates on the comic that you read when you run out of Homestuck updates. WARNING: Some later pages in this comic may cause seizures, but if you can read Homestuck and/or play video games, you should be fine.") # 799
