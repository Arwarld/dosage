Rating note- The following comic has been given a teen 14 rating for slightly offensive material. This means that it is suitable for people aged 14 and over only. The comic will sometimes have swearing, violence and mild adult themes. If you are of the following age and older, but still may find some of these themes offensive, read the information below as a guide to how often these themes may occur. Swearing- (50% chance) Some of the characters in this comic may swear depending on the situation. In most cases it will be a situation where a character is being serious and uses harsh language to get another\u2019s attention or when a character becomes overemotional. Violence- (Comical- 90% chance, Serious- 30% chance) This is a comedy, so cartoon violence is bound to occur. This will be done to a comedic effect and will have no blood or gore whatsoever. Serious violence will only happen when the comic reaches a semi-serious plotline like a threat or a character death. There may be blood, but it will be minimal at most (example- small cuts or nosebleeds). Some violence may also be silhouetted. Adult themes- (30% chance) Most of the adult themes in this comic are used in a comical fashion (example- \u201cThat\u2019s what your MOM said.\u201d). Most of these are not to be taken seriously and are not intended to offend. Again, these sort of themes may be brought up depending on the scenarios and characters.

The focus is shifted on genres of rock music who are represented by anthropomorphic characters. The characters are based off of artists or typical fans of that genre, however their personalities aren't as obvious as to avoid whitewashing characters with a typical stock trait. Their relationships with each other is based on how well fans of the music view other fans. There are over 30 genres personified so far and over 40 real life rock stars have made \"Guest Appearances\". References to actual rock songs are littered throughout the stories. Just about anything a genre says or does to another can have some intellectual hidden meaning for it. For example: When Grunge takes over lead guitar for Glam when he overdoses, it could resemble the early 90's when Grunge music virtually wiped out the L.A. music scene and their constant use of drugs. The characterss started off as simple drawings that represented a specific genre, and were eventually named for that genre.

At that time I created the first comic book issue of Tarman. I left the first issue on a cliffhanger and did not pursue continuing the series until I rediscovered this comic book during my high school years. I got a kick out of what I had written and desired to at least finish off the initial 7 parts in the same style. Over the years since then I've created almost 50 issues of Tarman. The style has undergone some slight modifications both intentional and incidental, but it has maintained the same sort of infantile spirit that had me laughing at myself when I rediscovered that first issue. That is to say that while there are some inevitable changes that have come over the course of the years, if you don't find anything funny about the first issue, you probably won't enjoy the comic as a whole. You may want to also try the second issue just to see the small change that comes with attempting to clone the style of a past self who was by then somewhat alien to me. Tarman is an antihero of sorts. One could even argue he's simply a villain who takes the mantle of a hero. This should become clear rather quickly as the comic progresses. Tarman should not be seen as my idea of a heroic or virtuous figure. He's not intended to be. Maybe he was when I was a child, but after I saw what I had created in the first issue, that notion clearly had to go. Besides, I was amused by his bizarre and unheroic behavior in the first issue and intended from the start to mimic it in later issues. Tarman's powers don't really make sense and I won't make any effort to amend that. The idea behind them was born of a misconception I had as a child on the role of tar in road repair. He might better be called \"tar and asphalt man,\" but he won't be. Tarman can shift between elastic, liquidy, and hard rocky phases and project weapons in these forms. In the first issue he is shown to throw what will later be referred to as a \"tar puddle\" at enemies. It is an amorphous, sticky somewhat elastic substance that ensnares his foes. He is also able to harden these tar puddles even from a distance to the consistency of solid road. Tarman will exhibit other powers through the series, but I thought it would be good to explain what you're seeing here as there is precious little exposition in the first issue.", 40, "Other", true], "Tarot22": ["http://tarot22.webcomic.ws/", "Since she was small, Agatha wished a simple yet nearly impossible wish, to have a large amount of very close friends.

But before the eldest of the 3 had drawn his last breath, he breathed out 3 simple souls, who were destined to defeat the monster his brother became. Many centuries passed, and many had tried to fight back against the murderous God. Nothing seemed to stop the beast from destroying the universe. And just when all hope seems lost a certain hedgehog by the name of Sonic, along with his two friends Silver and Shadow the hedgehog, become the new spark of hope. But can they stop this Dark God? Or will they loose against the greatest of evil?

These people look like the humans, but can turn into the mythological creature their village represents, be it Dragon or Gargoyle. They are known as Shifters. Humans in this Universe are seen as sacred beings that have close relations to the Gods. Their village is small, hidden within the mountains. Governed by monks, the society is upheld with a system of Council members that work as a conduit between the people and the monks. Everyone in the village works for their keep, aside from children and students; however if one of their own is old, handicapped, or cannot work the farm or the market, they are provided a home in the monks temple. Over time, the humans sent missionaries to the outside world, to help shape it and enlighten its inhabitants. Some villages welcomed the humans and accepted their way of life; together they built stronger societies. Other villages turned the humans away, thinking that their way of life was foolish. This caused tension and eventually a war that turned the human race into an endangered species living among the Shifters. Centuries later, a young boy named Lucius follows in his father\u2019s footsteps and becomes a monk. One day, he is asked to take part in a ritual that will help him cross over into the spirit world.

Lampooning superheroes, sci-fi and everything else, we take nothing seriously! Anyone who ever read MAD, Cracked, Stupid or Crazy Magazine growing up is already familiar with the style of parody that the Stupid Friends represents. Off the rails idiocy, sloppy art, a nonexistent fourth wall and inappropriate humor abound as a group of generic superheroes battle the forces of incompetence while hampered by bad art and worse writing. You can see all the art assets at http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Stupid-Friends/218498728162992?ref=hl The Stupid Friends will be published as a webcomic first and then collected into an actual print magazine and distributed via the web. Securing publishers and distributors is a difficult proposition at best. By utilizing the Kickstarter project, we intend to skip the difficult part of finding a distributor and simply build our base from our unique visitors. A truly funny and unique comic book ''magazine'' still has a place in the world and we believe that using the online webcomic format as an advertising vehicle to drive sales of the print magazine is a win/win situation. Of course, the print magazine will include bonus material not available in the online version. The series is largely black and white, with occasional colored pages and ''covers''. The black and white pages are published online as is and will appear side by side with color versions, if and when they are produced. Many fans enjoy seeing both versions and it costs nothing to offer this feature. In the print version, only the black and white version will appear, due to cost restraints. The Stupid-Friends is the ongoing adventures of five idiots with superpowers. Spending most of their time avoiding any real work, danger or responsibility, the Stupid-Friends pull out every cliche known to the genre. Characters die and come back on the next page, villains are ineffective, even petulant and one character goes so far as to refuse to participate and leaves the strip ''for good.'' ''Traps are meant to be sprung,'' as the heroes fall for every type of bait in the book, from captive teammates to stolen alien pr0n, with hysterical results. The bizarre antics don't stop with the regular cast, though, as literally hundreds of guest stars wait in the wings and most of them aren't too happy about it. Deadpool is rattled by the lack of a fourth wall, essentially nullifying one of his ''greatest powers.'' Wonder-Man dies and is resurrected repeatedly, each time returning in a different costume. Moe Howard of Three Stooges fame is transformed into an unstoppable revenge driven killing machine, and the XXX-Men are.... well, the XXX-Men. All of the plotting and dialogue has already been written for the first 200 pages of the Stupid-Friends, along with a series bible and most character artwork. Some minor scripting elements remain, as the plot, while banal, does get somewhat complex later in the strip when multiple threads come together in a climactic conclusion to some of the major plot elements. Along with the scripting details, there is some significant artwork to be completed, which is time consuming. When fully funded, we will be able to complete the Stupid-Friends in a more timely fashion and eliminate the need for expensive print-to-order schemes that drive up the price of these types of publications (making it cheaper for the consumer). Bringing a print magazine to fruition is a massive undertaking, but we already have most of the creative assets in place, leaving only the physical printing, publishing and distribution efforts (to say nothing of further advertizing). In short, the only thing that makes these types of publishing difficulties go away is money, which is why this project exists. So please support us and the Stupid-Friends, read our webcomic and help us bring it to the world in print form (so you can read it on the crapper). The Stupid-Friends is a ''reboot'' of a webcomic we published years ago but was eventually deleted from the archaic hosting service. All the physical art assets were also lost, but the basic plot and dialogue are easy enough to recall from memory. The effort to reproduce the strip is a labor of love and it is unlikely that anything can keep it from being published on the web. But as anyone who grew up reading comics will tell you, there is nothing like the physical print copy to hold in your hands. That is the purpose of this Kickstarter fundraising effort, to produce something we love to share with people who might enjoy it as much as we do.", 1, "Comedy", true], "Thesuitelife": ["http://thesuitelife.webcomic.ws/", "I live in university residence with my best friends.
