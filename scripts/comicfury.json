Rating note- The following comic has been given a teen 14 rating for slightly offensive material. This means that it is suitable for people aged 14 and over only. The comic will sometimes have swearing, violence and mild adult themes. If you are of the following age and older, but still may find some of these themes offensive, read the information below as a guide to how often these themes may occur. Swearing- (50% chance) Some of the characters in this comic may swear depending on the situation. In most cases it will be a situation where a character is being serious and uses harsh language to get another\u2019s attention or when a character becomes overemotional. Violence- (Comical- 90% chance, Serious- 30% chance) This is a comedy, so cartoon violence is bound to occur. This will be done to a comedic effect and will have no blood or gore whatsoever. Serious violence will only happen when the comic reaches a semi-serious plotline like a threat or a character death. There may be blood, but it will be minimal at most (example- small cuts or nosebleeds). Some violence may also be silhouetted. Adult themes- (30% chance) Most of the adult themes in this comic are used in a comical fashion (example- \u201cThat\u2019s what your MOM said.\u201d). Most of these are not to be taken seriously and are not intended to offend. Again, these sort of themes may be brought up depending on the scenarios and characters.

The series is a tongue-in-cheek documentary about rock music using personified subgenres of rock as characters Description The History of Rock 'n' Roll uses a format based on a mockumetary, outlining a very broad timeline of rock history, leaving room for any potential topics. The focus is shifted on genres of rock music who are represented by anthropomorphic characters. The characters are based off of artists or typical fans of that genre, however their personalities aren't as obvious as to avoid whitewashing characters with a typical stock trait. Their relationships with each other is based on how well fans of the music view other fans. There are over 30 genres personified so far and over 40 real life rock stars have made \"Guest Appearances\". References to actual rock songs are littered throughout the stories. Just about anything a genre says or does to another can have some intellectual hidden meaning for it. For example: When Grunge takes over lead guitar for Glam when he overdoses, it could resemble the early 90's when Grunge music virtually wiped out the L.A. music scene and their constant use of drugs. The characterss started off as simple drawings that represented a specific genre, and were eventually named for that genre.

At that time I created the first comic book issue of Tarman. I left the first issue on a cliffhanger and did not pursue continuing the series until I rediscovered this comic book during my high school years. I got a kick out of what I had written and desired to at least finish off the initial 7 parts in the same style. Over the years since then I've created almost 50 issues of Tarman. The style has undergone some slight modifications both intentional and incidental, but it has maintained the same sort of infantile spirit that had me laughing at myself when I rediscovered that first issue. That is to say that while there are some inevitable changes that have come over the course of the years, if you don't find anything funny about the first issue, you probably won't enjoy the comic as a whole. You may want to also try the second issue just to see the small change that comes with attempting to clone the style of a past self who was by then somewhat alien to me. Tarman is an antihero of sorts. One could even argue he's simply a villain who takes the mantle of a hero. This should become clear rather quickly as the comic progresses. Tarman should not be seen as my idea of a heroic or virtuous figure. He's not intended to be. Maybe he was when I was a child, but after I saw what I had created in the first issue, that notion clearly had to go. Besides, I was amused by his bizarre and unheroic behavior in the first issue and intended from the start to mimic it in later issues. Tarman's powers don't really make sense and I won't make any effort to amend that. The idea behind them was born of a misconception I had as a child on the role of tar in road repair. He might better be called \"tar and asphalt man,\" but he won't be. Tarman can shift between elastic, liquidy, and hard rocky phases and project weapons in these forms. In the first issue he is shown to throw what will later be referred to as a \"tar puddle\" at enemies. It is an amorphous, sticky somewhat elastic substance that ensnares his foes. He is also able to harden these tar puddles even from a distance to the consistency of solid road. Tarman will exhibit other powers through the series, but I thought it would be good to explain what you're seeing here as there is precious little exposition in the first issue.", 40, "Other", true], "Tarot22": ["http://tarot22.thecomicseries.com/", "Since she was small, Agatha wished a simple yet nearly impossible wish, to have a large amount of very close friends.

Lampooning superheroes, sci-fi and everything else, we take nothing seriously! Anyone who ever read MAD, Cracked, Stupid or Crazy Magazine growing up is already familiar with the style of parody that the Stupid Friends represents. Off the rails idiocy, sloppy art, a nonexistent fourth wall and inappropriate humor abound as a group of generic superheroes battle the forces of incompetence while hampered by bad art and worse writing. You can see all the art assets at http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Stupid-Friends/218498728162992?ref=hl The Stupid Friends will be published as a webcomic first and then collected into an actual print magazine and distributed via the web. Securing publishers and distributors is a difficult proposition at best. By utilizing the Kickstarter project, we intend to skip the difficult part of finding a distributor and simply build our base from our unique visitors. A truly funny and unique comic book ''magazine'' still has a place in the world and we believe that using the online webcomic format as an advertising vehicle to drive sales of the print magazine is a win/win situation. Of course, the print magazine will include bonus material not available in the online version. The series is largely black and white, with occasional colored pages and ''covers''. The black and white pages are published online as is and will appear side by side with color versions, if and when they are produced. Many fans enjoy seeing both versions and it costs nothing to offer this feature. In the print version, only the black and white version will appear, due to cost restraints. The Stupid-Friends is the ongoing adventures of five idiots with superpowers. Spending most of their time avoiding any real work, danger or responsibility, the Stupid-Friends pull out every cliche known to the genre. Characters die and come back on the next page, villains are ineffective, even petulant and one character goes so far as to refuse to participate and leaves the strip ''for good.'' ''Traps are meant to be sprung,'' as the heroes fall for every type of bait in the book, from captive teammates to stolen alien pr0n, with hysterical results. The bizarre antics don't stop with the regular cast, though, as literally hundreds of guest stars wait in the wings and most of them aren't too happy about it. Deadpool is rattled by the lack of a fourth wall, essentially nullifying one of his ''greatest powers.'' Wonder-Man dies and is resurrected repeatedly, each time returning in a different costume. Moe Howard of Three Stooges fame is transformed into an unstoppable revenge driven killing machine, and the XXX-Men are.... well, the XXX-Men. All of the plotting and dialogue has already been written for the first 200 pages of the Stupid-Friends, along with a series bible and most character artwork. Some minor scripting elements remain, as the plot, while banal, does get somewhat complex later in the strip when multiple threads come together in a climactic conclusion to some of the major plot elements. Along with the scripting details, there is some significant artwork to be completed, which is time consuming. When fully funded, we will be able to complete the Stupid-Friends in a more timely fashion and eliminate the need for expensive print-to-order schemes that drive up the price of these types of publications (making it cheaper for the consumer). Bringing a print magazine to fruition is a massive undertaking, but we already have most of the creative assets in place, leaving only the physical printing, publishing and distribution efforts (to say nothing of further advertizing). In short, the only thing that makes these types of publishing difficulties go away is money, which is why this project exists. So please support us and the Stupid-Friends, read our webcomic and help us bring it to the world in print form (so you can read it on the crapper). The Stupid-Friends is a ''reboot'' of a webcomic we published years ago but was eventually deleted from the archaic hosting service. All the physical art assets were also lost, but the basic plot and dialogue are easy enough to recall from memory. The effort to reproduce the strip is a labor of love and it is unlikely that anything can keep it from being published on the web. But as anyone who grew up reading comics will tell you, there is nothing like the physical print copy to hold in your hands.

They also knew of the existence of formless-parasitic beings from another dimention. And thus they keep the world safe from this unknown threat. However, a weapons company called Timberfield, accidentally opened the dimension of these formless beings they called \"Avarice\" because of their vicious greed and hunger for energy. They were successful in creating their first experiment, Libra, the first Avarice born into their world. Soon after, Libra rebelled and caused Timberfield to spiral downwards into oblivion. This sparked a 30-year war between Timberfield, Libra, and the assassins. The war ended with the defeat of Libra and by the interference of the Jubelius Knights (the military). The Knights and the public seek answers to what cause the war. Thus Timberfield, along with their remaining Avarice, went into hiding. The story revolves around a fox named Aeros Vangard who is a respective captain of the Jubelius Knights. He along with his companions are tasked to locate and retrieve the research data of Timberfield. However, unknown to the Knights, a secret organization of psychic assassins already exist to eliminate Timberfield. During one of Aeros' missions (the prelude comic), his team uncovered the existence of the Avarice to the world, also possibly throwing the world back into chaos by reviving Libra. With Libra's newly acquired body, he seeks revenge on Timberfield and unite his fellow Avarice.

Now the assassins and Libra (with the other Avarice) have to fight against the Knights to get to Timberfield who had spread awareness of them to the Knights.

There are a lot of things I have to back this up with, so dare I say, hes kind of an obnoxious, semi-narcissistic yuppie type guy who WILL (without shame) share his poetry with the rest of the world and loves that people listen with such intensity. He is god, isn't he? But however self obsessed, he's very caring and loving. Yin carries all the signs of water and earth both elementally and astrologically. Yang - Yang is considered the Devil, Satan or darker forces. Unfortunately, he's somewhat misunderstood. Because he's the opposite of God, this does NOT by any means mean he's evil. He's just very ambitious, as he's the carrier or wind and fire, the two elements associated with destruction. He's easily carried away and gets caught up with himself. No, he does not enjoy watching a human being whipped to death. Well, not necessarily. Let's just say his sense of right and wrong are a little hazy sometimes. Yin and Yang are not opposites, infact, far from it. They're very similar. Both as old as earth themselves, neither extremely compassionate towards humans (More of playthings, yes?) and both somewhat self absorbed.
