Rating note- The following comic has been given a teen 14 rating for slightly offensive material. This means that it is suitable for people aged 14 and over only. The comic will sometimes have swearing, violence and mild adult themes. If you are of the following age and older, but still may find some of these themes offensive, read the information below as a guide to how often these themes may occur. Swearing- (50% chance) Some of the characters in this comic may swear depending on the situation. In most cases it will be a situation where a character is being serious and uses harsh language to get another\u2019s attention or when a character becomes overemotional. Violence- (Comical- 90% chance, Serious- 30% chance) This is a comedy, so cartoon violence is bound to occur. This will be done to a comedic effect and will have no blood or gore whatsoever. Serious violence will only happen when the comic reaches a semi-serious plotline like a threat or a character death. There may be blood, but it will be minimal at most (example- small cuts or nosebleeds). Some violence may also be silhouetted. Adult themes- (30% chance) Most of the adult themes in this comic are used in a comical fashion (example- \u201cThat\u2019s what your MOM said.\u201d). Most of these are not to be taken seriously and are not intended to offend. Again, these sort of themes may be brought up depending on the scenarios and characters.

Humans live in what is known by all the other races of the universe as Dimension-1, and are only barely aware of the existence of mages, a powerful race that resides in Dimension-2. Mindless creatures known as Relentless roam through the dimensions and are hunted by specially trained mages known as assassins. Relentless only run on the primal instinct to eat, specifically peoples\u2019 souls, as they feed on negative energy derived from pain, anger, hatred \u2013 any negative emotion. The main plot of the story revolves around 17-year old Yuuki Ren\u00e9 Matsuzawa, a seemingly normal human boy originally from France whose family roots come partially from the prestigious clan of mages, the Matsuzawas, who hail from Japan. His older brother, Christophe, was born a mage, inheriting the pyrokinetic abilities of the Matsuzawas and developing a willpower so great it\u2019s downright intimidating. After the disappearance of their father when Yuuki was two, his brother left to study in the Academy, a school in Dimension-2 where mages are trained to be assassins, to become strong enough to protect him, but from what he was never told. They saw each other sparsely until the death of their human mother when Yuuki was 10, leaving the two orphaned and Yuuki left with no other option but to move to Japan to live with his grandparents on Matsuzawa manor \u2013 a country he didn\u2019t even know the language of and a family he\u2019d never met. An aggressive legal battle between his brother and the rest of the family ensued before he was finally back with Christophe and away from his eerily overbearing and threatening relatives, uncertain of why they were so intent on keeping him within the daunting walls of their land. At the start of the comic, he lives with his brother \u2013 an extremely powerful, rogue mage who unfortunately suffers from A-fib \u2013 and is about to start his final year in high school; but as of recently he has been attacked by Relentless and other creatures more and more often, to where it has become an almost a daily occurrence. After a sudden attack by a crazed aboscillix, another race from this universe reminiscent of a vampire and incubus, he is saved by Bleeding Heart, one of the strongest known assassins in Dimension-2 who is notoriously bloodthirsty and merciless despite his calm exterior.

Their genetics are so different and advanced that they are almost another species entirely. In an effort to create an army for themselves, they began making Jotunns, which are soldiers made from brainwashed plebs and irrits, all bound into suits of powered armor. As the lower classes are plagued by raiders, malicious rebels, misguided Jotunns, a horrific mutating virus, and their Optim overlords, a child is born, a hybrid that proves there is a future for a united human race. This child is Mihai, the only possible hybrid between all three classes of humans who unfortunately has little use of his legs. He is protected by a liberated Jotunn named Wilhelm, the armor of whom hides a dark past that only Mihai knows fully. In their struggle to survive, they meet allies and enemies, such as a soldier asleep from before the war, an immensely powerful psychic mutant, and an envious Optim child bent on Mihai's destruction.
